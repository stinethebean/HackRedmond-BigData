However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

It's done that way to make this yeast MORE fresh than those bagged with air still trapped inside which, of course, breaks down the yeast.

Because one of the authors of my bread cookbook won the highest award given for his breads and he wrote an entire foreward on using instant yeast and why you should and I was discussing this...she recommended this particular brand for both it's results, value, and taste from her own bread.I am an apt person to be able to compare because I've been using Fleishman's for a good while now and maybe it's my imagination, but I swear the LaSaffre gives me far better results. Because of freshness? Maybe. But it does.I have also found it at restaurant supply stores and I look at that as a good thing if bakeries buy it in bulk...Negatives: None as far as quality. Just know this is quite a large bag and you don't want air to break down your yeast so you either need to go through it quickly or store it in the freezer to maintain freshness if you aren't whipping out bread as fast as I am.  :-)Conclusion: Seems to work better, last longer, and is bagged for freshness while being cheaper. Worth it.","5.0","Great for the bread machine or any other yeast needs...this is NOT compressed yeast, it's regular granular.","1263513600"
"Roger","B0001CXUHW","One pound of yeast is a heck of a lot of yeast for the casual baker. I only make bread about once or twice a month so I barely made a dent in my supply after a year. And then... five years later. I still have about a quarter cup, and it's still good! I admit i didnt used it as consistantly as &#34;once or twice a month.&#34; I lost interest in baking for a year since i was busy in college and also used sourdough exclusively for a period but for the majority of the 5 years, i used this yeast to make 60+ batches of dough. All I did was pour the stuff out in two small jars and keep them in the sitting in the freezer door. Always had great rise and even after the 5 years, no noticeable loss of power.I remember back when i first taught myself to bake (about a year before buying this). The store only carried small packets of active dry yeast and they cost like five bucks for barely anything at all. To make matters worse, half of the time the yeast wouldn't even proof in the sugar-water solution. Maybe i was doing it wrong... but i don't care, it's too tedious to wait for it to proof. Bread baking has enough waiting periods as it. In my opinion, the one step process and idiot-proof qualities of instant yeast far outweighs the slightly lower price of (bulk) active dry.I've been baking a lot more recently so now i'm finally getting a refill. Hurray Saf Instant Yeast!","5.0","Great deal. store in freezer, lasts forever?","1403481600"

"Chandler","B0001FQVMK","A secret I have had for years is using sour cream and ricotta in my cheesecake (well, except for when I was vegan, but anyway...back to vegetarian now...) Although most recipes don't use it, you will DIE for the taste difference when you try it.Most cheesecake is heavy and pasty.  Using sour cream makes the lightest and creamiest cheesecake you'll imagine.  People have no idea how you did it, but they will go wild and you will wind up making them for Christmas presents each year.So, how do you gourmet-up the crust? Amaretti cookies, of course.  Well, sure you may want to buy it for the tin alone to keep on your counter or simply for snacking and filing up your sweet tooth by unpeeling their delicate wrappers and enjoying the almond-like flavor--but let's get to a recipe you can use if you want to get creative here:3 oz (about 20) Amaretti Cookies2 oz ( about 4 whole crackers) Honey Graham Crackers, coarsely crushedPinch of Salt5 tbsp butter, melted1 tsp Unflavored Powdered Gelatin3/4 cup chilled heavy Cream2 (8 oz ea) Cream Cheese, softened3/4 cup Ricotta Cheese3/4 cup Sugar1/4 cup Sour Cream1/4 cup Fresh Lemon JuiceDirections:To Make Crust:Preheat oven to 350.1. In food processor or blender, pulse the cookies, graham crackers, and salt until finely ground.2. Transfer the crumbs to a small bowl and stir in the butter.3. Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom and halfway up the side of an 8 in springform pan.4. Bake for about 10 minutes, until the crust is set. Cool on a rack.To Make Cheesecake:1. In a microwave dish, sprinkle the gelatin over 2 tbsp of cold water. Let stand until the gelatin is softened (about 10 minutes).2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat heavy cream until soft peaks form, refrigerate.3. In another bowl, beat the cream cheese, ricotta, sugar and salt with an electric mixer on high until light and fluffy (about 5 minutes).4. Beat in the sour cream and lemon juice.5. Microwave the gelatin until melted (5 seconds).6. Scrap gelatin into the cream cheese mixture and beat until fully mixed.7. Fold in the whipped heavy cream.8. Pour the mixture into the cooled crust and smooth the surface.9. Refrigerate the cake until firm and set (3 hours).These cookies are packaged in pretty pastel paper wrappers individually so they are lovely for putting in a bowl when having a party, but even as a snack right out of the tin they are sweet but not too sweet with a crisp texture and the taste of amaretto.","5.0","Sure they are great on their own, but they make a fantastic cheesecake crust","1380153600"

This is a light roast Greek coffee, which means it's blonder than even blonde coffee connoisseurs might be accustomed to. It's also a very fine grind, so fine it forms moist little clumplets in the bag. It gives off an aroma that puts me more in mind of baking cocoa than of Starbucks. And it brews up with a fine head of crema more naturally than any espresso I've ever had to tamp. The instructions on how to make Greek coffee are on the back of the bag, and the only thing you might be missing in your kitchen is a briki, but if you have a small pot with an interior that won't react badly with the coffee you will be fine, especially if the pot has some taper at the top. I had a fondue pot going unused that filled in nicely. The coffee really does have a strong cocoa-like flavor to it, it is not very bitter, and it tastes better with just sugar no cream.

The market had no idea how it got on their shelf but the computer checkout system was able to generate a price. Yum! And nostalgia.

Well, if you just want to make standard salad dressing, you can buy a decent balsamic vinegar for a third or maybe even quarter of the cost of this one.  But if you want one that you can use by itself in very small quantities, to dip bread in, or drizzle on a lamb chop, or maybe even on vanilla ice cream, and want a sensational taste experience that you just can't get from the products available in the supermarket, this is an excellent choice.

The Helpers kind of need doctoring anyway, so the odds and ends wind up well used, and the Helpers are so cheap it makes sense to use them as a recipe starter.

"csm","B000AY9U3O","This is one of those products that should be a staple in everyone's closet.  Right beside the Ritz and the Nabisco Premium Saltines.  I LOVE the buttery taste of these crackers and have been using them for about 35 years.  My parents before that always had them in the house. The one thing that can be a challenge is that I don't recommend that you put them in a bowl of canned soup.  The canned soup is usually overly salty anyway and these, well, they're a bit heavy on the salt as well.  If so, be sure to have steady access to water because you'll feel like you just consumed the Dead Sea!  Anyway, these crackers are best served with dips and made into appetizers.  They are quite buttery so if you think that might not work for you, try the Ritz.  They have a bit less butter and have a bit richer flavor.Great product, highly recommend!","5.0","Been using them for years!","1328572800"

"Kendra","B000B5KW8E","I'm always looking for no-sugar and low-fat foods.  Well, this one fits the bill and I really like it. I cannot understand the bad reviews here because, not only do I LIKE it A LOT, I like it much better than other jerky and good jerky is kind of a weakness of mine.  However, because each ounce of jerky elsewhere has approximately 5g or so of sugar, I have pretty much stopped buying it.The ingredient list on this page lists brown sugar as an ingredient. I am sure that means the non-no carb jerky. This particular jerky has no sugar at all, so no carbs. It is also 97% fat free and 50 calories per ounce.Other jerky-- even GOOD jerky-- usually has really tough pieces you have to throw away. I've had four of these packages so far, and there were no tough pieces in the bunch. Every single piece is completely tender.WHile I don't think it tastes like sawdust as another reviewer stated, I can see why she'd say this. It is not really dryer than other jerky, but it is crumbier. However, it's so tender and moist, I really can't see the comparison to sawdust at all.The flavor isn't as sweet as other teriyaki jerkies, but there is no sugar in this, and that's my main concern. Even if I didn't care about the sugar component, I would still buy this again and hope this company continues to make it and sell it on Amazon.","5.0","I love this stuff!","1280880000"

"Carol","B000CQBZQA","One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before.

I've eaten a few types of popular nutrition bars before, and they are either the really fruity-soft kind or the really nutty-hard kind, none have been like this --- the soft-but-hard kind. Let me explain, the thinkThin is a 2/3"" thick piece of chocolate bar formed with expresso inside, it's a very dense heavy chunk mushed together. And while you're suppose to 'think thin', the bar gives the opposite impression! And after taking several bites, you certainly dont feel thin, it's a very clunky taste, sort of soft but dry and hard paste that doesn't even have a very good flavor. Feels sort of like eating cardboard if cardboard had an edible texture! And you will need a drink to wash down your healthy bar!I do taste the expresso, not really the chocolate cause it's just a mess of flavors and none really stand out. It sure tastes healthy, if healthy means it has no [good] taste and we all know, healthy is something most people don't enjoy eating but only because they have to!""High Protein. Low glycemic.

"Patricia","B000E3VAOS","We are from New Orleans but now live in San Diego.  We could not give up New Orleans gumbo - no way.  This base saves you the trouble of making a &#34;roux&#34; - the gravy-like base that thickens gumbo and it also has the seasonings that give it the special taste.  We impress all our San Diego friends by having gumbo parties.  They have never tasted anything like it.The way we do it is to boil a whole chicken in a big pot, then pluck all the meat off the chicken and put it back into the chicken water, add all the stir-fried vegetables (onions, bell peppers, celery) and the mix and let it simmer for hours. We pan fry sausage and add it (New Orleans sausage is best but any good sausage will do).  An hour or so before serving we add shrimp and frozen chopped okra (the okra also tends to thicken it).  Delicious!  It should be thick more like a stew than a soup.  Then serve it in a bowl over rice.  (People not from New Orleans tend to use too much rice - there should be much more gumbo than rice. It is served in a bowl.)  For a big pot we use two of the mix boxes.  Once made it freezes beautifully.Back in New Orleans many of our friends and family use this mix too.

"Ghenghis","B000E3ZFBC","Having lived in New Orleans for awhile I'm intimately familiar with jambalaya, so I decided to try this Zatarain's JambalayaMix. This is a rice mix with all the proper seasonings included, but you can add garlic, cayenne, and sauteed onions, and tomake this complete...add chicken stock instead of water for a real treat. You can serve it as a side dish or add sausage,chicken or shrimp and make it into a full meal.Jambalaya is a Creole dish found in Louisiana that came from the of Spanish and French influence in that state. It firstshowed up in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The dish is a version of the dish Paella, a Spanish favorite. The Saffronin the dish was replaced by tomatoes and Caribbean Spices in the Jambalaya version. The tomato version is called redJambalaya or just Jambalaya. The Cajun version  or white version appeared after French Creoles melded into the Cajunpopulation in Louisiana.This version omits tomato and uses browned meat for color. Jambalaya is a combination of AndouilleSausage, Chicken and Shrimp or other seafood and stock and it's all cooked together with the rice added at the end.The flavor of this mix is the best of the Zatarain's products IMO. It is spicy and strong and tastes the least like a boxedmix. It has a nice orange red color and great aroma. You can use the Jambalaya mix as is for a side dish or add the differentmeats like Andouille, smoked sausage, smoked turkey, chicken, or seafood and create a delicious pot dinner. It's easy to make,looks great and has a delicious spicy kick. This and the Caribbean version are my favorite of the Zatarain's mixes.Zatarain's also offers Cheddar Broccoli Rice, Chicken Beef, Yellow Rice, Curry Rice, Caribbean Rice, Dirty Rice,Red Beansand Rice, Black Beans and Rice,Spanish Rice and Rice Pilaf as sides or main dishes alternatives.

"honeybee","B000E65OF6","Back in the days when Celestial Seasonings got started, this was the tea to lull you to sleep. Then the Hain company acquired them and started diversifying the Celestial Seasonings product line. There are now about half a dozen varieties of Sleepytime teas, including this one and another formula for kids. This version will relax you, but it doesn't have the secret ingredient found in Sleepytime Extra that will knock you out and keep you in la-la land for a good 6-8 hours. Valarian is what does that, and it's only in Sleepytime Extra. You'll pay more for the ""Extra,"" but it's a much better formula, if you really need a solid night's sleep.","3.0","Not as good as Sleepytime Extra","1352937600"

Although not as strong as the real thing, this infusion of apples, camomile, cinnamon and other spices is a mellower version of this favorite fall beverage. Add a bit of honey or Stevia to sweeten the brew and make all the flavors ""pop.""","5.0","The flavor of spiced cider year-round","1352937600"
"pumpkinspice","B000E65OII","I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter. When I opened the box, the smell was fantastic. I had such high hopes for this tea, but was sorely disappointed. It was much too sweet for me. I was expecting something that was heavily spiced, but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.I didn't want it to go to waste, so I experimented, trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied. I tried steeping it for a short period of time, making iced tea, adding a splash of milk, adding more cinnamon, etc. Nothing seemed to do it for me. I really wanted to like this tea, because it smells so great, but I guess I'll be on the look-out for something else.","2.0","Maybe it's just me","1288051200"
"honeybee","B000E65OJM","This is one of my favorite Celestial Seasoning herb teas. With its all-natural black cherry flavor, enhanced with actual bits of sweet cherries, blackberry leaves and hawthorn berries, you get a full infusion of this wonderful fruit to delight your palate--with or without sweeteners. Hibiscus flowers add a deep red hue to delight the eyes; rose hips add a bit of tartness and natural vitamin C. Tastes great hot or chilled. A terrific all-season drink.","5.0","Fun fruity flavor","1352937600"
"honeybee","B000E65OK6","One of my top 10 favorite herb teas, this is one my husband and I most frequently select. It is also one of the easiest flavors to find in stores and online. We love the sweet full-bodied flavor of the peaches, enhanced with blackberry leaves, orange peel and passion fruit. Serve it ice-cold, with honey or Stevia, for that down-home taste of the deep South during the summer. It's equally wonderful as a hot drink to warm you up on a cold winter morning. The chamomile makes it a great option, when you need to calm down after a tough day at work or relax at bedtime.","5.0","Outstanding peach flavor!","1352937600"
"honeybee","B000E65OKQ","Before I review this tea, I have to tell you a little story about how I came to be so familiar with it:For about a year, I worked in an office which provided services for mentally handicapped and developmentally disabled persons. I loved our clients and their staff. But one thing about the job I didn't like was reconciling their expense ledgers each month. I am more of a word smith than a numbers person, so checking their math and making sure all the receipts for each household were in order was a nightmare for me. Hence, the need for Tension-Tamer Tea. I found a box in the break room at the office, and it really did help me mellow out for this odious task. It wasn't long before all the staff made the connection. They knew that when I had a cup of Tension Tamer Tea on my desk that they needed to be extra nice to me, because it was ledger time!This tea is great. I'm not real fond of the picture on the box [Those of you familiar with the book of Revelation will recognize the symbol of the Scarlet Woman on the Dragon]. But the tea really does relieve tension.Of course, the peppermint, cinnamon, ginger, licorice and chamomile all help calm a churning stomach. Vitamins B6 and B12 are ""stress vitamins"" that give you a sense of well-being, keep your hair from falling out, prevent premature graying and boost your immune system. Eleuthero, or Siberian Ginseng, is known for its ability to reduce hypertension and inflammation, boost memory and increase endurance. Tilia flowers may be helpful in preventing headache and high blood pressure, as well. Catnip is a mild hallucinogenic in felines and supposedly has a numbing effect on humans. Hops, the main ingredient in beer, is purported to ease anxiety and restlessness.For those of you who hate the taste of ""medicinal teas,"" this one has a pleasant, floral-spicy-minty taste. Add a little honey or Stevia, and it's even better. Don't let your job, the kids, or whatever get you down; down a hot cup of Tension Tamer Tea instead!","5.0","Great tea to help you cope with stress!","1352937600"
"honeybee","B000E65OQA","I try to keep a box of Sleepytime Extra in my cabinet at all times. Let this brew in half a teacup of hot water and drink it before bedtime, and you'll sleep like a baby for hours. Unlike similar teas by other companies, Sleepytime Extra contains Valerian, which does the trick. Camomile teas are fine to relax you and settle your stomach, but this one quiets your brain and helps you sleep. With a bit of Stevia to sweeten it, the drink tastes mellow and soothing, as well. I even take a box with me on vacations, to help me sleep better in strange places.","5.0","Keep this tea handy for those restless nights!","1352937600"
"honeybee","B000E671W0","Peppermint is one of the top 5 most amazing flavors on God's green earth! And of all the brands of peppermint teas out there, Celestial Seasonings' peppermint is THE BEST!I tried growing my own peppermint to make my own tea. The plants grew like crazy (filled my entire planter and tried to go beyond that), bloomed and everything. Problem was, the leaves, when brewed, tasted smoky.I don't know how Celestial Seasonings manages to find such perfect peppermint leaves and cuts them so they release such heavenly flavor. I DO know they have an entire room at their factory in Colorado Springs dedicated to storing nothing but peppermint, so it doesn't get into the other teas. If you've never been there, you gotta go. The tours are free and they have a gift shop with bargain-priced goodies and samples of their teas.If you read the ingredients on the box, all you find is ""peppermint""--nothing else is added to enhance the color or flavor. Brew a cup, sweeten to taste with a bit of Stevia, and viola!Peppermint stimulates the brain, clears your sinuses and wakes you up better than any caffeinated drink, plus it's not addictive. It also helps settle your stomach and can prevent motion sickness. And what else says Christmas like this delightful hot or cold liquid that tastes as sweet and wonderful as the best candy canes on the market--without the artificial red dye?","5.0","Ahhh, pure peppermint!","1352937600"

If you love the flavored teas in the restaurants during the spring and summer months, well, this will definitely be a treat you won't want to miss.  My son begged me to buy it for him at the grocery and what a neat product!  It's just very, very good, very fast to make, and you don't even have to add sugar.  I'm always amazed at very highly convenient products like this so, I have to ask the question, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!  Anyway, sure would have been wonderful to have on my trip to England - unless you're in London, it's VERY hard to get a great glass of iced tea.

"honeybee","B000E67206","This is a nice, tart herb tea (not always readily available) that tastes great--especially around the fall and winter holidays. Its ingredients are pretty simple: cranberry and apple pieces, spiced with cinnamon and chicory, with a bit of hibiscus for coloring and blackberry leaves and camomile for added flavor. The tea does contain soy lecithin, so if that's a problem for you, you'll want to skip this one. With a bit of honey or Stevia to sweeten it, Cranberry Apple is a nice full-flavored tea to wake up your taste buds and compliment your turkey dinner at Thanksgiving or Christmas.","4.0","A fall favorite","1352937600"
"honeybee","B000E67210","I love peppermint, so my sweet husband bought a box of this tea to try. Unfortunately, he did not realize how much I dislike spearmint, which is also in this tea.What really ruins the flavor of Mint Magic, however, is the other ingredients--roasted chicory, cinnamon and orange peel. In combination with more robust teas, chicory is a nice, nutty additive. Cinnamon and orange peel are wonderful with fruity teas, but not with mint. These ingredients change the tea from a refreshing, cool flavor, to something more warm and spicy. Clearly, they don't go together!","2.0","Mint flavor ruined by other ingredients","1362096000"

"honeybee","B000E682F0","A true believer in the benefits of herbs for prevention and treatment of disease, I decided to give this tea a try a few years ago. I worked in an office where we were exposed to just about every cold and flu bug that came down the pike. I figured a little echinacea in my tea might help prevent those nasty secondary bacterial infections--such as bronchitis or sinusitis--that often follow viral illness.With the addition of eucalyptus, menthol, peppermint, licorice and anise, the tea tastes okay (unlike some other medicinal concoctions). However, the anti-biotic herb is just too diluted to do a sick person much good. It's better to get your echinacea in capsule form.Also, if you are allergic to ragweed, this may not be a good tea for you, as echinacea is from the same family of plants and may cause serious side affects to sensitive individuals. In that case, I would recommend astralagus, a natural Chinese immune system booster, instead.","3.0","Not the best way to fight a cold.","1352937600"

Definitely can taste the bitter/bean flavor if you lick the spatula of cookie or brownie dough, but once cooked I couldn't tell that it was there.

I find myself eating them way less because I don't really like them.

If I want to thicken a soup, this is basically natural powdered potato...think about the betterment of flavor that this adds as compared to arrowroot (which breaks down if heated too much when cooking) or cornstarch or flour--all flavorless.  I use it in dips that are low fat for a better mouthfeel and thickener that just feels creamier. I use it in vegan dishes to replace some creams or cheeses in soups, I use it in place of flour for gluten-free items.Mixes are improved and flavors are enhanced in ways rice flour, tapioca flour, and other gluten-free flours can't do.It creates a base for a roux in ways you didn't think of...get cookin'  Wake up your soups!

I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.

"jeninmaine","B000EDI2VM","Update from July 2012:I just got my latest Subscribe & Save shipment of this product and it is different!  Previously I was receiving ""Organic Live Food Bars, Cashew and Agave Nectar, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)"" and now it has been changed to ""Organic Live Food Bars, Golden Cashew, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)"".  The biggest difference is the size - the bars are now 1.8 ounces each instead of 2.2 ounces, FOR THE SAME PRICE.  I didn't receive any notification that this was a new/different product and as I've been getting it regularly for so long I wouldn't have thought to check the product page here on Amazon.  Nice bait and switch, there.  Kind of ridiculous that I'd need to be vigilant about such a thing.The product tastes more or less the same (though for some reason the description ""golden cashew"" weirds me out, the name no longer mentions agave nectar though it's still in the ingredient list - maybe there's less of it?) - it's actually oilier, as hard as that is to believe, and is now about the size of a granola bar.  Disappointing.Review from December 2009:I like to have healthy, filling snacks on hand for those times when I rush around to get the kids out the door, sit down to work and an hour later realize I never ate any breakfast.  The Raw Revolution bar is a great source of energy - I can eat one and not be too weighed down, but have enough energy to work out before eating lunch without bottoming out.Some reviewers don't like the taste, I find it mild and not unappealing.  I love dates and this tastes quite a bit like them, with some crunchy nutty bits now and again.  It's slightly thick in consistency (as energy bars are wont to be) but with a glass of water easily palatable.The one huge drawback and why I can't rate this five stars is that it's just so oily - the inside of the package is slick with it and I can't even hold it in my fingers without getting grease all over them.  I don't understand why there needs to be this much oil, this bar would be perfect with less than half the amount it contains.I checked the nutritional information and one bar is 280 calories, 140 calories of that is from fat - a whopping 16 grams!  Why so much?  Is it the cashews?  I don't see any added oil in the ingredients so that's the only thing I can think of.  Perhaps they should consider adding more almonds and cut back on the cashews to make the bar less greasy.","3.0","Tastes good, but why so oily?","1259712000"

"ringo","B000ESJR20","I'm also a grind-your-own bean type, and I adore this coffee.In addition to the other praises heaped above, I would also point out that it dissolves REALLY well, and is therefore excellent for iced - I put a couple of heaping table spoons in a quart jar (I like it strong), add about a half-cup of hot water, and then top off with cold water, milk, and agave nectar. Minimal fuss, and no energy wasted to heat water just to cool it down again.For a while I was religiously consuming a (12-ounce/three dollar!) bottle of organic flavored iced coffee every morning. When I realized I could recreate the same beverage for about thirty cents using my own organic spices, sweetener, and milk the cost for a jar of this stuff suddenly didn't seem so unreasonable.","5.0","Great for Iced Coffee too","1229299200"
"Muttley","B000ESJR2A","I have some sort of caffeine sensitivity. Any caffeinated drink causes me having sleeping difficulties as well as nervousness and some anxiety. Therefore I gave them up totally 5-6 years ago. Since then, I have been trying different decaffeinated options for my favorite drinks like tea and coffee. I bought this through amazon subscribe and save program twice. I know many people out there prefer filtered coffee over the instant freeze dried version, but for me the difference is subtle, especially when you find a good one like this. I like the convenience in this instant coffee, besides it produces no wastes which means you use a lot less than what you would normally use in your ground filtered coffee (so it is not a good idea to compare the prices/ ounce values of instant and ground coffee)It has real good smoky flavor as well. The major selling point for me is the decaffeination process used to remove the caffeine. Not all decaffeinated coffee are the same, most brands use a petrochemical treatment to get rid of the caffeine and that rises health concerns. This one uses  a natural carbon dioxide based method that, while effectively removing the caffeine, does not leave nasty chemicals behind. Being a certified organic item is another plus especially when considering that conventional coffee beans are known to be treated with harsh chemicals during farming. So it gives a piece of mind too.One thing to keep an eye on is the price for this 6 pack item. I have seen it doubling and getting back to original price in less than 6 months in amazon. So if you can order a 6 pack for around $35-40 (after subscription discounts etc.) then you are OK, anything more, I would wait or look for other items...","5.0","very good alternative to the filter coffee but keep an eye on the price","1397520000"

The very initial taste was that they were ever so slightly different from Venco. However, after working my way through a few bags, that difference is no longer there or evident. These are every bit as good. So much so, I ordered a 2nd dozen only 2 days after receiving the first dozen. They have the right sweetness, chewiness and hardness.

For taste I would recommend the Wasa Rye crackers with slightly higher carb count of 11 for 2 crackers, but much better texture and taste.

Dr. Oz said that his family eats Artichoke Pasta and he thinks is a great alternative to regular Semolina pasta.  The woman who loves eating pasta said that it was very good and that she would start eating the Artichoke pasta instead of the Semolina pasta due to the nutritional value of the Artichoke pasta.  I have to agree that I could NOT taste a difference!  This review is coming from and Italian woman.  I have been eating pasta since before I could talk so I am not pulling your leg that this stuff is good.  It is expensive so I will use it as much as I can afford to but if you want a great alternative to regular Semolina pasta that you and your family will like, buy some Artichoke Pasta!

"kale","B000F30MLO","I recently tried this as an alternative to soft drinks and also because I wanted to cut back on artificial sweeteners (I do use some, but decided that we know a lot more about the effects of sugar and how much sugar one should reasonably consume).  This is very lemony, tart but sweet, and of course you can mix it to your own taste.  Also, consider the work involved in hauling 34 quarts of soft drinks from car to home!  To me, this lemonade is every bit as good as Sprite, Fresca, ginger ale, or other lemony drinks.  Also, the mix dissolves completely with just a few stirs of a spoon.The only caution I would offer is that if you pour it into a tall, narrow glass, your dishwasher may not adequately clean the interior bottom of the glass--my dishwasher does not.

The product features a perfect blend of sweet, sour and spicy flavors that elevates an otherwise ordinary menu item to the extraordinary.My first experiment consisted of simply spooning a small amount of sauce onto a slice of ham, and in minutes I had a delicious main course which more than complemented the other parts of my quick-fix meal. I found the experience remarkable, given how difficult it can be to add flavor to ham!Since then, I have adapted this versatile sauce for use with other meats, salads and desserts. The key is the unique mixture of flavors which suits a wide range of recipes. I have found that from the quick and easy to the sophisticated, the Fischer & Wieser sauce provides a great solution to a number of cooking challenges.I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get more enjoyment from home cooking!","5.0","Perfect blend of sweet, sour and spicy flavors","1233100800"

"Grace","B000F3V880","I tried this sauce with a Trader Joe's fish fillet, and my impression was that the sauce overpowered the taste of the fish.  It was too sweet as well.  Mango already has lots of sugar, and the ingredients section lists sugar as the second ingredient, with honey added as well.  That's a little overboard, I think, and it tasted it too.  On the other hand, the ginger taste was strong and the sauce had bite, though the spiciness did not stay long on the tongue. All in all, the sauce seemed more like desert syrup than marinade/dip for a main course meat dish.","4.0","Too sweet for my taste","1237766400"

It was not too sweet, not too hot and not too robust. I think the big bad wolf would have found it boring.I won't be buying this particular sauce again but I will try a couple of the other flavors this company offers.

"audrey","B000FA38ZY","I've heard people for years rave about Malomars, so how could I resist tasting what all the fuss was about? First made in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1913 (now made in Canada), the package states that 70% of these cookies are sold ""in the shadow of the Big Apple"". Eighteen cookies in the carton, 2 cookies per serving at 120 calories, 5g of fat; unfortunately there's high fructose corn syrup, so I won't buy more.The cookie itself? A B+ in my book. There's a good sweet dark chocolate shell around a fluff of marshmallow atop a cookie. The chocolate and marshmallow are very good together. The cookie has a good flavor but is overpowered by the other two, and it crumbles too much -- I always wind up sprinkled with crumbs; at the end there's a slightly salt finish. Very nice. I can see why people like these, but I'd probably take an Oreo first.","4.0","delightful cookie .... but very crumbly","1320796800"

And there's a bit of light crispy/crunch to the chocolate layer too...so it's a good bite, you will want to savor the taste in your mouth a bit :) Let it rest on your tongue and taste the soft textures.I've never had MalloMars before, but heard of them and am glad to finally have tried them, very yummy taste! It's great with something to drink, like milk :) Definitely a treat for those days you're getting that sweet-tooth feeling!

"Sadie","B000FA38ZY","These cookies don't travel well.  Mine came in a box without any extra cushion and about half the cookies crumbled.  Well, at least the bottoms did.  The bottom layer is disc of crumbly cookie, like a graham cracker, only it doesn't taste like one.  Next comes a big dollop of marshmallow and the whole thing is covered in a tasty hard chocolate.  You really need to experience the entire cookie in its many layers to appreciate it.  Removing one of the crumbled bottom layers covered in chocolate and popping it in my mouth didn't do a thing for me.  But, sinking my teeth through a whole cookie allowed me to experience all the flavors together.  And, I must say, these babies are addictive.  I've never tasted one before, but now I'll have to put blinders on when I pass by them in the store.They still need to work on the shipping issues.

The mix had mostly green olives, quite a few olives were mashed. They were a little salty for my taste, so I soaked the batch which I was serving as an app in clear water to release some of their salt. I probably won't be ordering these again - I didn't care for the taste and they aren't an especially good value: I recently found out that a Town and Country supermarket in my area with a great olive bar regularly has 6.99/lb specials on olives, including Moroccan and Castelvetrano.","2.0","Just OK","1300492800"
"Muttley","B000FAIR96","I like 'if you care' products due to the fact that they are both nature and health friendly (  as far as I know). Most other baking cup papers are bleached white paper (which means chemicals had been used to make them seem pretty) plus contain pictures or images (which means lots of chemical colors were added). Under high heat these artificial materials can leak and end up in your cupcake. Although I can not say no chemicals were used in this item, at least those very obvious ones were not. Therefore, I chose this brand over the others, but the drawback was the hefty price tag in the local groceries. Buying bulk and using the amazon subscribe and save service, I could go round this problem. But to get a decent price you have to invest in 1440 individual cakes which is no less than a lifelong stock for someone like me who bakes cupcakes once in a while. In my few experiments , they hold well under high heat and generate decent cupcakes so the product is fine...If space is not a concern and you are not against bulk buying, I ensure you this is the best price you can find anywhere and you will never run out of them (well, for a very long time)...","5.0","lifelong stock for a decent price","1397347200"

Unfortunately, it was a BIG MISTAKE. This stuff was horrible.1. The initial look? Disgusting. (See photo.) But I forged on because looks aren't everything.2. There were actual pieces of basil in the mix (see photo) but they were dark green/brown and barely distinguishable.3. The smell wasn't terribly enticing, either.4. The noodles--which they say take just 3 minutes--don't. I trusted that and they were still hard and not fun to eat. I could hear my TMJ-jaw cracking with each bite.5. The finished dish wasn't terribly appealing-looking, either.6. It said 1-2 servings but it was barely one. Maybe if you put three cups of chicken and veggies in it...but then the servings go up to 3-4. Ha.7. It was SPICY. Nose-running and lip-burning spicy, in fact. And not even a tasty spicy.I knew as I was eating it that the remaining five boxes are either being donated to the food pantry or going in the trash (Amazon doesn't take grocery returns). I can't see the addition of chicken and/or veggies helping out this stuff in any way at all. To the reviewer who said this is exactly like the Basil Chicken he gets in a Thai restaurant? Oh my, I feel bad if this is what he gets in a restaurant, and I'd suggest he find a new place.So please, if you think you REALLY want to try this stuff, please please please try a single box from the grocery store first--like I should have done and was originally going to do.","1.0","Seven reasons of yuck.

I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it!I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me.

"Jenn","B000FDDESC","This is the third Hodgson Mill break machine mix we have tried and so far it is our favorite.  While I think their white and wheat are fine, they are nothing special.  Now I am not sure about the cheese portion of this particular flavor, but you can certainly taste the herb half of the flavor, especially rosemary.  It nicely complements Italian meals, or any other meal for that matter.  Mix makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf but also includes instructions for adapting for a 1 pound loaf and cooks on the white bread cycle of your breadmaker.  Mixes are easy to make, you only add hot water and butter.My only concern about these mixes is that the yeast does not have its own expiration date on it and I am suspect that it will be good until the expiration date on the bread mix.  The ones I just received (rec'd Oct 2012) have a use by date of Feb 25, 2014.","5.0","Yummy bread--a nice change from white or wheat","1352419200"
"Jenn","B000FDDESM","This is the third variety of Hodgson Mill bread mix we have tried, and so far it's the best of what we have sampled.  However, for whole grain bread, it isn't THAT tasty.  Nonetheless, is is infinitely easier to make bread from this handy little box rather than tracking down and assembling all of the ingredients on their own.  This mix makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf, which lasts about one meal at our house.  The procedure is pretty simple, add water, then the flour mix, yeast, and some butter and turn on the machine and wait (you only supply the butter and water, everything else is in the box).  The six boxes actually don't take up that much room, so it is not too burdensome to buy this quantity and it is handy to have the fixings for fresh bread readily available.

After really getting in to studying the science behind a good loaf, I began buying wheat gluten. Even if a recipe doesn't call for it I add a small amount (amount is listed on box of what to add to a loaf so it's failproof).The real test was when I added this to a sour cream bread I've been making for ages in our bread maker and everyone declared it ""the best bread recipe"" I'd made...but it was my old recipe.It really does make it more like the gourmet loaves you might scarf down at a favorite restaurant or like those made with fresh yeast when you are just using the dry yeast packets. It rises better, and the texture is better and I swear the taste is better in our opinion.I can't get wheat gluten at my regular grocery store and it was far more costly at specialty groceries around here...it lasts so I just got the box of it here, with no tax it was a better deal for me. I mean, you get a pack of 8 boxes. Cheap.Negatives: I'd love to be able to order less at the same discount but I took the bags out of the boxes and they take up very little space in my cabinet.

"Chandler","B000FEH8ME","I was certain I'd prefer the blueberry flavor when I got both blueberry and cherry of this Pure bar as I'm a far more of a blueberry fan than a cherry fan due to the typical acidity of cherry...but the cherry one was by far my favorite of the two. Very smooth cherry flavor. Although I'm also a big fan of the cashews...both for nutritional reasons and flavor, you won't taste much cashew in the bar, per se, as they are finely ground.Did I like it a lot? Yes.  Did I crave more? Not really. But I tend to eat more veggies and protein than I ever do fruit as a personal preference so, that being said, I think they may very well be ""crave-able"" to fruit fans wanting a healthy boost.I workout every day and love a good energy-burst bar prior to doing so, but have found most powerbars are packed with refined sugar and artificial ingredients. That's a boost that undoes all the good my workout does! So finding one that's filled with good natural things is always a quest I am on. While some of the newer bars have ""natural"" ingredients, however, this one goes a step further by having those natural ingredients also be organic...so the chemicals used in growing fruits in some bars that may or may not be washed off prior to processing into a natural bar is not a concern here. That's especially good for a healthy snack for kids, but is a preferance for myself as well.The bar is entirely ""raw"" organic foods...the best for your body, filled with antioxidants. It is high fiber and has 400 mg of omega 3s...very important and many would rather eat a treat than salmon. They are gluten free, dairy free, nongmo.The ingredient list is basic...no refined sugar, just organic cherries, nuts, dates...natural things.These are certified organic. Some foods that claim to be organic have been shown not to be...so this stamp is important meaning it's regulated. They are low sodium.So why one less star? The small bar also has 200 calories. That may not matter to many, but I am short and also have a small build and 200 calories for a snack is actually too much for me if I don't want to undo an entire workout. Eating this as an energy bar prior to a workout would, therefore, undo my whole workout. I wish they could lower the fruit sugars a tad...BUT, that sad...this bar kept me full for a LONG time!! Because of the high fiber and good whole foods, it lasts so it's great to pack if you know you are gonna be on the go somewhere with little time to grab something healthy.","4.0","A very healthy ""power bar"" filled with great things; I liked the cherry flavor over the blueberry","1274313600"

"ephemeral","B000FEH8ME","The Organic Wild Blueberry Pure Bar is a filling snack that is a good source of both fiber and protein.  As indicated  by the name, all the ingredients are organic, and additionally, all the ingredients are also raw.  The taste is mostly nutty, with the combination of walnuts, cashews, and almonds overpowering the blueberries quite a bit.  I often find that snack bars, especially those with nuts, are difficult to chew, but this bar is fairly soft and easy to eat.  I would eat this product again, but I do wish it tasted more like blueberries.  I'd recommend it to nut-lovers.","3.0","More nutty than fruity","1272844800"
"FLYingG0D","B000FEH8ME","I was expecting a traditional cherry flavoring used in typical candy or granola bars. However, this bar had a different taste. The cherry flavoring has a bit less kick as it is not a sugary fruit snack, but it also tastes closer to the cherries in a cherry pie. I presume this is due to the cherries being thoroughly cooked before used in the production of this bar.The cashews are still crunchy, but the walnuts are really showing through. They are the dominant nut in this bar.These Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are quite dense. They remind me of protein bars and other bars made to stave off hunger. As dense as these little guys are, they should keep you going for a while before you need to eat. Excellent for those who might not have time to eat, but need something to help them get through the day.With the density, moistness and organic ingredients, these guys do not seem like they will last too long in your pantry. I wouldn't stock up on them, but rather order them periodically so you keep a fresh supply. Other than that, they taste great and are awfully good to eat!","5.0","Reminds me of Cherry Pie!","1274313600"
"Grace","B000FEH8ME","This is my first time trying PURE fruit and nut bar.  I don't know what I was expecting, maybe the taste of a regular trail mix bar.  It's hard to describe what the PURE bar (blueberry flavor) tastes like, but it's not an unpleasant flavor.  The fruity flavor is obvious, and the nuts do not overwhelm the tastebuds.  I like that the bar is soft and chewy, and not too sweet.  Also, it's made out of all natural and organic ingredients, with nothing processed.  That to me is worth having a bar that doesn't have the conventional taste of other energy bars.  The taste is not bad, but it's not delicious either.  However, the bar is filling and doesn't make you feel guilty about eating it, because the ingredients are so healthy.I would recommend these bars as snacks, but they do have plenty of calories, so I wouldn't eat too many of them at once.

"jt","B000FEH8ME","This is a pretty good bar.  It has a real nice fruitiness to it.  The cherry flavor is sweet-tart but not overly tart like a kids candy.  For me, the cashews is what really wins me over.  A 1.7 oz. bar provides 190 calories (8g fat, 25g carbs, 7g protein).  Not bad.  Compare to Odwalla bars that come in at 2 oz. and 200+ calories.  Personally, I would like the bar to be a little bigger but, I often eat these bars either as a meal or while I am walking a round of golf so I want as many calories as I can get.  The package is almost twice as long as the bar (marketing trick).Considering this bar is free of preservatives, trans fats, cholesterol, refined sugar, gluten, soy, and dairy it is pretty good.

All of them have 16g of sugar, except the dark chocolate berry bar, which has 17g.  Looking at the ingredients, just about everything provides some sugar, even if it isn't refined sugar.  Lots of fruit, which I expected, but is agave nectar really needed as an ingredient for all of them?  Some have it for the second ingredient.  After a quick internet search, I found this statement, with lots of information to back it up: ""Agave nectar is bad for you. It's not traditional, not natural, highly refined, and contains more concentrated fructose than high fructose corn syrup.""  The bars all have 190 or 200 calories, and 1.7oz in weight.

"Jenn","B000FF9DV2","What is not to love about Pirate's Booty?  It's cheesy and delicious.  It is one of the first foods we used for snacks for toddlers and beginning eaters because while it is similar to cheese popcorn, it dissolves easily when chewed, making it much less of a choking hazard.  At the store, generally you can only find really large bags of this though and we could never finish one before the bag got stale.  While the half ounce bags are not the most cost effective, I would much rather pay a little more and be certain we will consume 100% of the product versus throwing half a bag away every time.  The amount in these bags is more than adequate for a single serving, especially for a child--great alternative to chips for school lunches!  And at only 65 calories per bag, you can enjoy one too!  Bags are the size of the type you would typically buy for school lunches and have always arrived in great condition.  Amazon typically puts the PB box inside of another one for shipping, but even occasionally when they have simply arrived in the manufacturer's box (which is quite sturdy) we have never had any damaged product, and we have been ordering these for years.","5.0","Perfect portion size for little pirates","1345593600"

"Kendra","B000FIDLNU","Since I'm constantly trying to get enough protein (it's recommended one has at least one gram of protein per pound of body weight), finding a good breakfast cereal has been an issue for quite some time.  If I'm limiting my caloric intake, making certain that such a large proportion of that intake is from protein is very difficult.So many cereals deemed ""healthy"" aren't as healthy as they would have you believe.  My husband, for instance, bought some Smart Start cereals, but if you look at that label, it's clear that the cereals just aren't that good for you.  That one has over 200 calories per serving, almost 20g of sugar per serving, and only 5g of fiber.  Of course it tastes good. So does Frosted Flakes!Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus, on the other hand, is actually GOOD for you.  Don't be fooled by the plain Special K cereals-- they are missing the protein they need to make those cereals balanced meals.  This cereal, though, has it all. INCLUDING TASTE!Only 100 calories per serving, 5g fiber (proportionately better than the aforementioned cereal), ONLY 2g sugar, and-- here's the kicker-- 10g of protein!  And, that's what I'm always looking for in the foods I choose-- at least a gram of protein per 10 calories.And, what is really surprising is that this cereal is delicious.  I like cereal with flavor, and this has it. The texture is crispy, but nicely soggy in my skim milk, and there's a hint of nuttiness to it.  Additionally, it's sweetened slightly.  Sometimes, though, I sprinkle a packet of Equal on it if I am really craving something sweet.  Either way, it's very very good!Kellogg's Special K Protein Plus is perfect for breakfast and it's perfect for an evening snack.  It's great any time of the day.  Finding a low cal, low sugar, high protein cereal that is moderately low in carbs was impossible before this came on the market.

They taste great and dissolve quickly leaving a wonderful minty aftertaste. Possibly if you carry the cute tin in your pocket and jostle them a lot, they might fall apart. But mine are right by my work station and another tin is in the vehicle.My interest in these began with reading a website of a dentist named Scott Frey. Apparently the birch sugar used in these cannot be utilized by the oral bacteria that cause dental plaque and decay.

"Poogy","B000FL08B0","Yes, I know, I know, agave nectar is supposed to be the answer for for those seeking to address insulin issues, or on low-carb diets, or just want a healthy alternative to sugar, and even honey and maple syrup, let alone high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners. Yes, I've done the research, am personally interested in both organic and low glycemic index products, and used agave nectar for a couple of years myself, proudly serving it to my friends.Despite the great enthusiasm for agave nectar and the endless hype from folks who should know better, I hate to tell you, but it's baloney--a very successful and clever marketing campaign to promote a sweetener that's no better for you, and very likely worse, than many of the other sweeteners it replaces.First, forget any mental image of a ""nectar"" naturally flowing from the majestic agave cactus; this product is created in factories through a chemical refining process, much the same way as high fructose corn syrup, from the starchy root of the agave plant and is, in fact, a refined high frustose product stripped of any nutrient value. It has a higher fructose content than high frustose corn syrup. While high fructose agave ""nectar"" won't spike your blood sugar levels, the fructose in it will cause: mineral depletion, liver inflammation, hardening of the arteries, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, obesity, and may be toxic for use during pregnancy.If you think I'm making this up or shilling for some manufacturer of a competing sweetener, just google ""agave fraud"" and see for yourself. I wish it were otherwise.On October 27, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported:""[T]he Glycemic Research Institute, a Washington, D.C., laboratory, issued a warning Friday that diabetics experienced ""severe and dangerous side effects"" during testing of an agave nectar. ""The diabetics passed out on the floor and had to be taken to the hospital,"" says Ann de Wees Allen, chief of biomedical research at the lab. She declined to say how much of the product the diabetics consumed during the test, saying that would be disclosed after a complete analysis of the results....The lab has stopped testing agave on humans amid safety concerns. Also, Dr. Allen says the lab refused to test four other agave products after a chemical analysis it commissioned from another lab found they were mixed with high-fructose corn syrup, which was not disclosed on the label. She declined to name the brands.""Wikipedia's entry for agave notes: ""the extremely high percentage of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and accelerated uric acid formation,"" citing:Basciano H, Federico L, Adeli K (2005).

"naturegirl","B000FL5OMI","I am a big fan of Numi's regular Black Vanilla tea and was pleased to find that they are now making a Decaf version, and so I ordered the multipack. I found it a bit lacking in flavor and aroma at first, though, something like what you would expect from a second brewing of a bag of their regular Black Vanilla tea. When I tried it on its own, with a tiny bit of honey but without milk (which I always put in my regular Black Vanilla tea), I did have a change of heart. This is a lovely, mild black tea that can stand alone, as opposed to the regular Black Vanilla which can be a bit too bitter and strong without milk to mellow it out. And so, if you like your tea with milk or cream, I recommend the regular Black Vanilla, which is rich with intense vanilla fragrance and flavor that can stand up quite well to the addition of milk or cream. If you like it plain, though, I do recommend this Decaf Black Vanilla, as it really is quite mellow and lovely on its own. In addition, I will add (since I think if you like one you will really enjoy the other) that Numi's Earl Grey teas are our favorite Earl Greys, and both the regular and decaf version are potent with a heady bergamot note unlike that in any other typical Earl Grey. I have had both with milk and honey, and both stand up quite well--even the decaf version. I never really considered Earl Grey to be as special as I do now, since trying Numi's Earl Greys. Try them as well, and I think you will have found a couple of new favorites.","5.0","the decaf is a lightweight with milk, but quite good on its own","1386288000"

"nonpareil","B000FZYMJK","To me this rice is so different than my regular rice (long grain brown) that I think of it as a different grain. Yes, the aroma is interesting; I'd say it takes a bit of getting used to. I really enjoy the size and texture of the cooked grains. After trying the Wehani by itself, I began cooking 1/3 Wehani, 1/3 Lundberg Brown Basmati and 1/3 either brown rice store brand or Wang sweet brown rice that I get at an Asian supermarket. I always saute the rice in a bit of vegetable oil 'til it is browned, before adding the liquid. This combo and browning seems to develop the nutty flavor that I favor. [However, I've found that when browning the rice, not to overdo it because if the rice gets too roasted it will no longer cook normally - apparently it loses its ability to absorb water. Then you get the crunchies.]I do find that Wehani takes considerably longer to fully absorb the water. I use the regular 2:1 ratio, water to rice (plus salt). It is my practice to bring it to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2 hours. It just means planning ahead a bit further.Often I cook meat at the same time in the same pot, starting both together so the rice will gain the flavoring of the meat juices. When I do that, I adjust the other liquid downward. The one alert I'd post is that the strong coloring of the rice stains the meat, especially when using the Wehani alone. Doesn't bother me, but you might want to know this will happen.Chilled cooked Wehani rice makes a fine salad with the addition of minced garlic, fresh ginger root pared then diced, finely sliced scallions, chopped fresh parsley and Chinese five-spice. Add other garden veggies that you have on hand, extra virgin olive oil if you wish and consider the taste treat of balsamic vinegar. Yum!","5.0","Good hot or cold","1306454400"

There were more green beans than anything, and they were mushy, but they're always mushy, right? There's a nice amount of tofu and I appreciate the fact that it is firm, since I do not like eating soft tofu.

Once the bag is open, there is no stopping me until I have eaten every chip.First, the texture. They are quite thick, not paper-thin and crumbly like some others. They have a substantial presence and a satisfying crunch. They stand out in a crowd.Second, the taste. I was fine with the idea of chili in a chip, but I wasn't sure about &#34;sweet&#34; or &#34;garlic.&#34; However, they got it just right. There is just a hint of sweetness that moves these away from being BBQ chips and into a category of their own. There is just a touch of garlic that, again, refuses to allow them to be ordinary BBQ-flavored chips. There is the perfect amount of seasoning on each chip that keeps you wanting to take just one more.

But, how to you really open a bag that you want to re-seal? You can't. You just can't. The notch to rip open the bag is about 1/3 of the way in from the edge of the bag, it rips straight down, and then you've got a big ole huge gaping hole in your bag. You can't fold it over easily without having a clip. More often than not, you'll rip the bag open and it rips nearly all the way to the bottom of the bag. I am convinced that Kettle does this on purpose so you'll have to eat the whole bag and just buy more. It's really annoying.","4.0","Great chips!","1402704000"

I also like that there is no trans fat.I have heard a lot about sriracha (a Thai chile sauce often referred to as &#34;rooster sauce&#34; because of the familiar rooster on the bottle of the most popular brand), but have never tried it before these chips.  If you are like me and have not tried sriracha, let me warn you, it is hot!  I am from Texas and don't have a problem with foods that are spicier than average, but these were a little too much for me.  If you like habanero sauce, you will probably find these chips right up your alley.

"Ghenghis","B000G6TNTW","You're not going to be using big dollops of it like you're pouring maple syrupon pancakes anyway. The first thing I noticed is, and you can see from the photois that it comes in a cruet that has a beaker lip spout for pouring out preciseamounts. It's sealed with a cork---how cool is that? You can, indeed, re-use thiscruet for other things once it's empty. It's made of thick, quality glass. So,you're not only getting this absolutely outstanding sauce, but you're getting afree cruet along with it.What makes this sauce so great? The sauce is just Red Savina Habanero peppers,salt, and vinegar so it not hiding behind a ton of other ingredients. Don't getme wrong; some Caribbean style hot sauces really shine with other ingredients likelime juice, garlic, papaya, and fruit juices. But I'm a huge fan of sauces wherethe pepper itself is the centerpiece. This sauce is also a mash, but closer to apuree, roughly the consistency of tomato sauce. So, it's thick not liquidy. Themore of the pepper that made it into the bottle, the better.Now, where the rubber meets the road. First, there's something mysterious andalluring about the name ""Red Savina"" that puts you to mind of exotic, tropicallocales with coconut palms, fresh seafood, tropical fruit, pristine beaches, andsteel drum music. Well, they made the Red Savina to be hotter than the standardissue Habanero, but in my best opinion, the flavor increased too. The fruitinessand savory-ness of the chile come shining through. See, this is why I love theHabanero. No bitterness at all, just pure chile flavor, and a tropical fruitlusciousness to it that just makes you come back for more and more. This saucehas all that---and more.The heat? Well, this one, you feel the heat at the roof of your mouth and from thereit migrates to between the top of your upper lip and nose. And on the tip of your tongue.It's hot, but not so hot you can't stand it. Yes, it's hotter than anything you're goingto find at the supermarket. But this is the pleasant slow burn that lingers for ten minutesafter you've eaten it.

People often push Mexican vanillas on me, as though they're the best, when they're rarely even pure vanilla. Pure vanilla is more expensive than the artificial stuff, but the sweetness, complexity of flavor, and general warm, home-baked goodness of your baked goods will make them the envy of others.The vanilla I used before this one came from a spice store - and it's a very good vanilla, especially if you buy the double strength - but this vanilla has a little more complexity and I don't think you have to use twice as much to get double strength.  (I don't believe Nielsen-Massey sells a double strength.)  If a recipe calls for a teaspoon, just use a generous teaspoon and you'll have all the vanilla flavor of a double strength.  If you're concerned about thinning the sauce or whatever it is you're making, you can also use this company's vanilla paste, which is syrupy.  Just one caveat: that product has real vanilla bean in it, which means whatever you make will have small pieces of vanilla bean in it (like Breyer's ice cream that is made with vanilla bean in it - the pieces are so small you lose no creaminess in that ice cream or in anything you bake with this product - but you can see them in both of these separate products).Here's the bonus, though: this product sells for less than half of the price of the vanilla I used to get at the specialty spice shop, yet I've lost none of the rich vanilla flavor.

"Jennifer","B000H27NU6","I loved the rave reviews and I wanted to try something other than my Costco-sized Swiss Miss...so got this. My first surprise was that you need to mix it with milk! Yes, I should have realized that from the small canister (no powdered milk in the mix so it's smaller!)...but I've never bought anything other than the big canisters or the individual pouches, so I didn't even THINK that this would require milk. So that first mug (made with water) got dumped out. But, since we have a toddler in the house we always have milk, so it wasn't that big of a deal once I knew.So, I tried it and...I have to give it a big MEH. Yes, it's chocolaty--but almost too much so. It's so rich it tastes THICK, if you know what I mean. And even though the powder fully mixes, I still want to say it tasted gritty or powdery or something. It was strange. And the recommended 4 TBS of mix seemed like A LOT for 8oz, so I tried less and that didn't work, either.So for the price and expectation, I was disappointed. I think this might be more of a ""special treat"" type hot cocoa, rather than an everyday hot cocoa. I'll be going back to mySwiss Miss Milk Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix 56 Oz Value Cannister.","3.0","NEEDS MILK! Actually too rich.","1319846400"

The can also lasts twice as long with fewer calories per serving.And for those of you who don't always have whole milk in the house, this hot chocolate tastes just fine if you make it with powdered milk instead.

"Rachel","B000HDOQ5U","If you've tried a gluten-free diet, you might know just how difficult it is to get fiber in your diet that comes from grains.  This cereal is a great step in that direction.  A 3/4 cup serving provides 24% of your daily requirement of fiber - and it's good for protein, too. The cereal is very crunchy, but if you like it a bit less crunchy, just pour on the milk and let it sit for 5 minutes or so - it will still have crunch, but not quite as much.  (Be prepared for these little cereal pieces to swell like crazy when they absorb milk - might explain why they're so filling!)The biggest drawback of this cereal is its price.  You get 5 servings in a box.  When I first ordered it on Amazon, it was between $34 and $35 for 12 boxes (with free shipping and subscribe and save).  Don't know why, but the price has jumped to about $20-$25 more per 12 boxes (that's close to $60 for a case of 12 boxes)!  This change just happened in a week's time, and I have no idea why.  That's crazy!!!  I looked for these at my local whole foods coop and found them for $3.30 a box - still more than what I used to pay on Amazon, but much better than the current price.

No chemicals here.I e-mailed Oskri because there seemed to be a discrepency on their nutritional info on different sites. So if you were confused too, here's the deal. They recently switched to using real fruit like strawberry, mango, etc in their flavored bars. They said this does, however, add to the total amount of sugar in the bar. So unfortunately there is more sugar in the flavored bars, but the trade off is you are getting real fruit and it tastes better, and the plain bars still have lower sugar content if you are concerned with that. The strawberry flavoring is worth the extra sugar for me, though.","5.0","Simple and delicious","1325980800"

Two hundredyears ago, Jeremiah Colman took over a mustard manufacturing business using seedsgrown locally around Norwich, England. The mustard was bold and spicy, made fromwhite and brown mustard seeds. It had a kick and not only did it pack a wallop, butin 1866 Queen Victoria literally ""knighted"" it by granting Colman's the ultimatehonor: ""By Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen Manufacturers of Food and Households.""What was good enough for the Queen's royal kitchen was more than welcome in kitchensaround the world and thus Colman's became known as ""The Queens Mustard"".Enough history... unlike some competitors, this is 100% pure mustard flour made froma blend of premium brown and white mustard seeds. Just a pinch or two adds bold flavorto your favorite recipes, dry rubs, roasts, chicken, etc. When blended with water itbecomes the same hot mustard you've enjoyed for years with egg rolls in your localChinese restaurants. It is gluten-free and contains no dyes, chemicals or preservatives.One tin will last a very long time.There are so many uses for this wonderful stuff the list is too long to post, I eventried it today in a bowl of corn chowder and the result was phenomenal, and after about5 bites my ears began to tear and my nose began to run, what a feeling. And maybe thebest thing about Colman's you wont be cheated with these little 2oz. tins, they areall overfilled so be careful opening, and the top design lends a very tight seal tokeep this powder fresh for months.

"Jennifer","B000JSQKL6","I love to keep this on hand to add to everything from soups to sauces to dressings, even in marinades. It has a fantastic tart flavor which is more complex than vinegar or lemon/lime juice, so it really enhances a dish. It seems to keep in the fridge pretty indefinitely so it's a good item to just have on hand. I use about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon at a time, so even this small container really stretches.My only complaint (which is rather inevitable) is that the container gets extremely sticky and messy, and the threads in the lid get gunky and hard to open. For a product with the consistency of molasses this is kind of to be expected, but I would be really impressed with a container design which avoids this problem. Maybe even a squeeze tube if you could find it.I definitely recommend this as a cost effective flavor booster for all kinds of foods.","5.0","Great flavor and value","1398470400"

Need to perfect that so it doesn't get too soft.  The flavor is different:  It's like going from beef to game meat.  I think we'll get used to it.  Corn is the first ingredient and quinoa the second so don't know how much of the healthful stuff is in there.Edited 6/18.  One reviewer said she checked and it's 75% corn, and my son said it tastes like a corn tortilla.  I found the best way to cook it is to add lots of cheese to the dry pasta, put milk just to the top, and bake it for 1/2 hour or so.  Not overcooked, but gritty with a strong corn flavor.

I can't think of any &#34;real food&#34; that's analogous, but I didn't find it difficult to eat in that sense. No, my problem with this particular flavor is that upon opening the wrapper, it smelled like Play-Doh to me. I'm sure it doesn't taste like Play-Doh though I have no idea what Play-Doh tastes like, but the smell was very similar to me, and that sort of impacted my palate expectations in a negative way.I'll see if I can gift away the rest of the box and then try the carob cocoa version.","3.0","Functional food, keep for real emergencies and trail","1390608000"

"Rachel","B000LKTP9G","These crispy apple chips are just that.  Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?

"CMB","B000LKU1LW","I have ordered the Organic Valley 1% plain and chocolate milk and this product line by Organic Valley is great. I am someone who likes to have milk on hand but I dont drink enough to buy a regular half gallon from the store without it going bad before I finish it.  This product line allows me to throw a few in the fridge to get them cold and they last a lot longer due to the boiling process of the milk that removes the bacteria that makes milk go bad. This is very much worth the cost.  It also tastes great.  This Vanilla Lowfat Milk in particular tastes like milk with vanilla extract in it. That is the best way I can describe it for anyone who thinks they might like it or is wondering what it is like, you may want to put a little vanilla extract in your milk and if you like that you will probably like this.  It was a nice change up from regular and chocolate milk.  I also would like to comment on the expiration date as when I originally started purchasing this product line from Amazon I had read reviews about people being unhappy with the amount of time before expiration. I have purchased from this product line probably 6 times now, with 1% regular, chocolate, strawberry & vanilla milk in the 12 packs and 24 pack of regular 1% and I have never gotten anything that expired in less than 4 months.  I also confirmed with Amazon.com prior to starting to purchase this product that if I received a package with an expiration date I was unhappy with they would send me a new package. That has not happened though.  I have been very happy purchasing from this product line and will continue to do so.  If you like milk with a touch of vanilla extract you will probably like this particular flavor.","4.0","A nice change","1372982400"
"Jenn","B000LKU1LW","Love that this milk is organic and that it does not need to be refrigerated.  We keep some on hand at all times for we forget to buy milk so we can make it until the next day.  Also nice to take to restaurants where they don't serve milk for the kids or for school when you want to make sure they are drinking organic.  Do wish they had other choices other than just 1%, but oh well.  It's a bit expensive for milk, but the price is for convenience.  One thing that I really do like is that Organic Valley still has the larger opening at the top of the milk, because most often we pour this into a spill-proof cup of some sort for the little one.

I ate Campbell's for a while (the orange tomato soup is pretty tasty) but it has several unhealthy ingredients so I tried to find a 100% natural product. I tried a couple and they tasted pretty bad. Pacific soup was such a pleasant surprise. I couldn't believe how good it tastes. I usually add some raw broccoli and green onions, croutons and some shredded cheese. I can't eat more than half of the small box at a time, so this is the perfect size for me. I am a little disappointed they dont have it in stock anymore.

The price right now ($20.00) is a killer deal, especially, when you use subscribe and save to get it for 17.08 for 12 cartons. That comes out to $1.40/carton!!

This bar is a great break from the extremely high fat content of the 85% bar (15g as opposed to 25g!), but still rich and has a beautiful chocolate taste with a wine-y undertone.

They also sell non-organic udon noodles that look and taste about the same for less than half the price.  Is the ""organic"" worth the extra money?  You have to decide for yourself.Udon is a great general purpose noodle.  For a quick cheap tasty bowl of noodle soup, just boil some udon noodles and add some miso soup paste and vegetables.  One 3 ounce bundle of dry noodles conveniently makes a nice serving of cooked noodles.  A bowl of soup like this takes about the same amount of time to cook as instant ramen, but since the udon noodles are not full of salt and oil, they are a lot healthier for you.  Yes, udon does cost a little more than instant ramen, but you can save money by going with the non-organic noodles, and they are still much healthier than instant ramen.You can also stir-fry the noodles or make them into a salad.

"Muttley","B000LKXFMO","I am a person who avoids canned food at almost all instances. The main reasoning behind this is the BPA concern. I am sure most people have already heard about it but for those who are not familiar, BPA is an endocrine disturbing chemical found in most clear plastic items as well as canned food linings. This chemical supposedly leaches into food especially at high heat or acidity and may end up some physiological problems in the body, especially growing children are more vulnerable. Since I heard this I put glass jarred products above all and eliminated canned stuff almost 100% from my shopping lists.However recently some brands moved to BPA free cans so that made me reconsider my hate towards canned food. Although I still believe that the best can is far worse than glass, I gave this product a chance. All muir glen tomato products are in BPA free cans. You can observe it yourself just by looking at the lining of the can. If the lining is white or metal color, then it is a BPA can if it is golden,copper, orange (like Muir glen) than it is a BPA free can. BPA free cans cost 2.2 cents more per can but I believe this has good impact on the total sales of the item so for a company it is still a good investment.Tomato paste is a life saver especially in winter months to add taste to your meals. I have grown up in mediterainen  region where tomato pastes are part of daily life (mom used to make for herself but it is not that cost effective in USA) tomato is known to be treated with nasty chemicals which, without proper washing, would get into the paste and concentrate in it so I wanted to buy an organic variety (eliminates most of the chemicals) and this item is great in that aspect as wellThere are four selling points for this item :1- Very tasty (can be among the top tomato pastes I have ever eaten)2-Very affordable (1 can around 70 cents) good deal with subscribe and save (price has been consistent for over 6 months which is an extra plus)3-BPA free can4- OrganicRecommend this product wholeheartedly for everyone...","5.0","I hate canned food but I love this one...","1397952000"

Instead, it lets you actually experience the flavor of the chilis front and center, while also complementing it with a strong garlic taste. I love to put this on hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as ramen noodles. Of course, feel free to experiment, I still experiment putting this on anything and everything if I think it might taste good.Believe it or not this sauce is made in America, despite its non-American-looking bottle.

I would recommend buying this (the 28oz bottle) as it is a much better deal than buying the smaller (17oz) one.","5.0","Rooster Sauce...","1313452800"

"JavaGuy147","B000LQORDE","Definitely better than the cheap ramen you find at the grocery store. A dollar a packet really isn't that steep, and you realize this when you try them. First off, the packets are noticeably larger than other ramens, with quite a bit more noodles. Then there's the fact that it comes with a spice packet that seems larger and more filled than competing ramens. It also comes with a dried vegetable packet, a very nice touch. Make sure to read the instructions, they're a little different then other ramens (you just place everything in at once and cook). The taste is phenomenal, nice and spicy (especially if you add the whole packet) with firm noodles that are more chewy that ""normal"" ramen. A very nice Asian spicy flavor. If you are not one with hot/spicy foods, consider using half a packet of seasoning. Definitely a must try, and I will be ordering more in the future!","5.0","Nong Shim Ramyun","1324339200"

"naturegirl","B000LWCR26","I am really enjoying this tea, which I have purchased from Amazon many times now. I can see why it is called ""honeybush,"" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are. If you are looking for a mellow and pleasant cup of tea that is smooth and easy without being harsh on the stomach or nerves or, alternately, putting you to sleep, I recommend giving this honeybush tea a try.","5.0","new favorite everyday tea","1390780800"

And he makes those pancakes in big batches so we need the big bags of this stuff.But if it weren't for that, I wouldn't buy Pamela's. It contains dairy products, nuts, xanthan gum, baking soda/powder, and other additives that I can't pronounce. That means I can't eat the finished product (allergic to dairy) or serve it to friends' kids (allergic to nuts). I also can't use it in a lot of GF recipes because those recipes already call for xanthan gum, baking soda, etc., and it's nothing but a wild guess to adjust the recipe successfully since I don't know how much of these ingredients are already included per cup of Pamela's flour. Given the great expense of GF ingredients, it is very disheartening to watch a cake blow up in your oven because there was too much leavening.That being said, I know lots of people who love this mix. They use a lot of her recipes from her website and find them fabulous. Perhaps their only concern is gluten, and not nuts, dairy, or additives. If that's you, then you'll probably love this.

There are some great recipes on Pamela's Website as well, especially the one for Cornbread. It really taste good to mix butter(or margarine) with some roasted pecans and a little honey as a topping for it. It makes really good pancakes too. The bread recipe makes a nice loaf, but I would consider it a desert bread, so although it does ok even if it isn't toasted, it's not really good for sandwiches, but it does work very well when you spread jelly or a chocolate/hazelnut spread on it.

"Jennifer","B000NMJWZO","Even though I grew up with Bisquick and love it, we are always looking for new and different pancake mixes...so I was excited to see all the rave reviews on Pamela's Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix Wheat-Free & Gluten Free (on Amazon). It wasn't until after I purchased it that I even noticed it was what-free and gluten-free.Well, let me just tell you, at least for pancakes, this stuff is NO Bisquick. Bisquick still beats Pamela's by a country mile (or six). I cannot fathom how other reviewers there likened this to Bisquick or even better than Bisquick. NO WAY, NO HOW!Now, the pancakes were certainly not BAD--and I could see how if your diet required you to eat wheat- or gluten-free, then the pancakes were probably even good. But to say they were better than Bisquick? Never. Bisquick pancakes cook up light and fluffy; Pamela's pancakes were too moist and dense and flat and didn't even cook like regular pancakes (they don't bubble up like normal pancake batter, so we were a bit confused how to cook them). We even tried a few different cooking methods (temperatures) and none came out any better.Can you tell I'm a Bisquick girl? :) Here, let me get it out of my system: Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick.The bag says ""Makes waffles, scones, muffins, loaf cakes, cookies, biscuits, coffee cake, and more"" and there are recipes on the package for all of those, including a banana loaf cake, pumpkin loaf cake with nut topping, sour cream coffee cake, zucchini loaf cake, chocolate chip cookies, and (I kid you not) Bisquick-Type Drop Biscuits. :)I did make a batch of chocolate chip cookies with the mix and those were good--they didn't taste any different than regular cookies made with flour. But for the regular person (i.e. you don't NEED this type of product) then it's certainly more expensive than flour. I am definitely going to try a few of the other suggested recipes to use up the rest because we certainly aren't going to make pancakes with it.It is costly: $40 for three (3) 64oz bags (or $13.33 per bag). If you sign up for the ""Subscribe & Save"" it drops to $34, or $11.33/bag or 17c/oz. That sounded like a good deal at first, but a 64oz bag isn't nearly as big as I thought it was. Compared to (are you ready?) Bisquick, which I can get a 96oz box at Costco for about $9 or 9c/oz...it's almost double the price. So unless you NEED this, I wouldn't buy it.INGREDIENTS:Brown rice flour, white rice flour, cultured buttermilk, natural almond meal (may appear as brown flecks), tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, potato starch, grainless & aluminum-free baking powder (sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, potato starch), baking soda, sea salt, xantham gumALLERGEN INFORMATION: CONTAINS TREE NUTS AND MILK*Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue & Autism Support, and Research Organizations, and is a member of the American Celiac Disease Alliance.I am giving the mix three stars out of five. If I needed the gluten-free aspect I would probably rate it much higher (at least 4 stars, if not 5). But as just your Average Joe looking for a pancake mix to replace Bisquick...or something to replace flour, I'd give this three stars and advise you to stick with Bisquick (or whatever product you currently use that you like).","3.0","If you don't need a wheat- or gluten-free product, stick with Bisquick.","1258156800"

Would definitely recommend to anyone with kids or infants instead of other sweetened snacks (that would probably contain some kind of weird chemical)...this stuff is all natural.The 9 grams of sugar may be a bit much for an 2-3 year old to have more than one or two per day (unless you don't mind them running around with their arms above their head, bouncing off walls, and yelling with a big smile on their face.)On a final note - this review is for the Strawberry flavor.  While it does have sweetness and light strawberry flavor, it is rather ""tart"" for a strawberry.  In fact, the ingredients don't actually list ""strawberries"" anywhere in them:  Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.  With that said...the apple puree/apple juice taste like they were Granny Smith or maybe Gravensteins.So, while not exactly tasting like a fresh picked strawberry by any stretch of the imagination (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), they are very tasty.  (If given a Strawberry one without knowing which flavor it was prior, I don't think everybody would agree that it's strawberry.)  At any rate, I will certainly buy these in the future - will try other flavors to see if they all have ""tart apple with hint of &lt;flavor>"" flavored.","4.0","These are FANTASTIC...just not quite strawberry.","1222041600"

"Kendra","B000QFRJSA","This is the best mass market hot sauce available. It's a tad more expensive than the big players such as Frank's or Tabasco, but the flavor is far superior and not overwhelmed by excessive heat.  There are hundreds of specialty hot sauces out there to choose from. Most are sold on the heat or the packaging but are rarely sold on the flavor.  My husband uses this sauce constantly and it works at every meal (even scrambled eggs).  He also uses it in his chilis and his spaghetti sauce.Here's a hint: In my husband's superb spaghetti sauce, he goes for intense garlic and basil.  He adds ground black pepper for a standard heat-- but just a hint.  He also adds a tablespoon of Cholula, too.  The Cholula lends just a slight touch of heat but adds a lot of complexity to the flavor, so the sauce remains an Italian spaghetti sauce, but certainly is tweaked so that there is no other sauce like it and few better!The packaging is beautiful and the wooden top is a nice touch.

"Carol","B000R71WMQ","When I first purchased this vinegar at a GNC after reading the reviews posted here about a year ago, I decided on taking it via a shot, as a way to chase it down quick, and to avoid further erosion of my teeth enamel. Don't do it.I had my mom do a shot of vinegar with me once, and she didn't know she was supposed to tilt her head back and take it down in one shot...She kind of burned her esophagus and got nauseous. I also quit for a few months because I was tired of/disgusted by the flavor of undiluted vinegar. Needless to say, don't take it in shot form, especially if you have a damaged esophagus.I now have taken up my vinegar drinking habits and use it like one would use a lemon (in cold drinks and dishes). I add two teaspoons to iced tea, and if you don't smell it, I swear it tastes just like a lemon iced tea. Use it in coleslaw and salads; The possibilities are endless. Just don't use this vinegar when cooking food, because high heat kills all the beneficial enzymes swimming around in the vinegar that make it have such marvelous health benefits.And please don't complain about the taste. This is vinegar; you cannot get around that fact. If you can't stomach the taste, try using the smallest recommended amount (one teaspoon), dilute it in a large cup water or (natural) fruit juice, and just drink it. If you have to use a sweetener use the recommended honey, stevia, black strap molasses, or Maple syrup; Agave can probably be used as well.My recent bottles, although cloudy, didn't have a mother floating in them.","5.0","It's vinegar!","1329177600"
"Chandler","B000R71WMQ","As the owner of a chicken rescue/habitat I look into many cures and as a weight loss coach, I've known about apple cider vinegar for people for a long time. As someone who studies canine nutrition, it also comes up often, and as someone who is healthy, this has long been known as a cure-all...back generations upon generations.Organic chicken farmers across the nation put apple cider vinegar (raw like this)(just a few tsp in a big waterer) in the waterers. Otherwise, mold grows in waterers and mold is toxic to birds. Yep, it kills bacteria naturally THAT well--both outside and inside the body.  Better yet, it's a natural wormer...and if you ate grass all day you'd need a natural wormer too.It's not just a wormer though...this kills lots of bad bacteria in the gut, while leaving the good. So it naturally rids pets and people of parasites and bad bacteria without anything harmful--in fact, it's REALLY good for you in many ways.This may be one of the reasons it also cures acne and gives you a glowing complexion.The recent weight loss studies are extreme in their results...it coats your stomach and stops your blood sugar from spiking...even good Ol Dr. Oz says it works...stops cravings, put it on a salad before you go out to eat and you'll even eat less. If I am between meals and dieting, I do a shot of apple cider vinegar or eat it on a salad. It really works. Long term use results in you not craving things like sweets.Here are some other goodies:Diabetes. The effect of vinegar on blood sugar levels is perhaps the best-researched and the most promising of apple cider vinegar's possible health benefits. Several studies have found that vinegar may help lower glucose levels.High cholesterol . A 2006 study showed evidence that vinegar could lower cholesterol. However, the study was done in rats, so it was too early to know how it might work in people. More studies since have proven this to work.Blood pressure and heart health. Another study  found that vinegar could lower high blood pressure. A large observational study also found that people who ate oil and vinegar dressing on salads five to six times a week had lower rates of heart disease than people who didn't. A new study found 2 servings per day cured high blood pressure naturally in many patients after two weeks.Cancer . A few laboratory studies have found that vinegar may be able to kill cancer cells or slow their growth.  It is used in naturopathic medicine.Weight Loss . For thousands of years, vinegar has been used for weight loss and has been shown to help curb hunger. A 2005 study found that those who ate a piece of bread along with small amounts of vinegar felt fuller and more satisfied than those who just ate the bread.  Consequent studies have shown the stabilization in blood glucose has also helped with weight loss and cravings with very strong evidence.Though it may be hard for others, many drink this in water...mix with a sweetener of your choice. You get used to it!You could just have it on a salad, or do a couple shots per day.I have cured sick animals with it...my chickens love the taste of it in their water.  I put it in there often as a preventative so I don't have to medicate with toxic chemicals. Only a small amount...they still need fresh water! Just a few tsp for a big waterer.It has also cured some things for me...it really helps with having flawless radiant skin and because I work out a lot the sweat can lead to clogged pores. This seems to balance the pH of the body and lower bacteria naturally even in your pores.I know the farmers who use it to cure animals naturally on organic farms say that ridding the body of negative things in the gut and internally wiping out bad bacteria and replacing it with the positive ""mother enzymes"" in raw organic apple cider vinegar can change everything.It is my understanding that raw organic apple cider is the best.I can say I've seen it rid the body of things and I have seen overnight changes and I have seen great weight loss and I have seen clearer skin.Oh, did I mention many use it as an anti-aging elixer?There are actually entire books on raw apple cider vinegar cures.I don't think the brand of raw apple cider vinegar matters...but the raw kind is not as easy to find and so I do buy Bragg who makes theirs that way..but it's not the brand that matters, it's the drink that matters no matter who you get it from; it's good for you..and your pets.Note: do not use this ALL the time in water for dogs as too much acidity can hurt their teeth; just rotate it.","5.0","Cures everything...even in pets.

"Kendra","B000SDIO3E","Just tried this for the first time today. My favorite coffee bean so far is Starbucks French Roast and Verona.  And, although some people insist Starbucks burns their beans, I love the taste of it.  Still, we bought a new DeLonghi machine to take the place of our broken espresso maker and I decided to try this more ""authentic"" coffee bean.I found this to be a poor substitute for my favorite. It was definitely weaker in flavor, not rich but tasted watered down.  Yes, it made some thick crema but that also dissipated more quickly than the Starbucks.My husband, who is one of those people who insists Starbucks burns their beans, also didn't like this quite as much.  Halfway through his double espresso, he did say he felt the effects of more caffeine, but I didn't.  I can drink espresso at midnight and go to sleep without a problem at 12:15, so I don't think caffeine really affects me at all. Still, he's never said that about Starbucks. That's not a criticism, it's just a comment-- probably the result of the 20% Robusto beans.After a couple of cups (not all at once), I suggested mixing this half and half with our French Roast so this wouldn't go to waste. It really didn't improve anything so maybe I'll try a 2:1 ratio next time.I really wanted to love it, but it just wasn't for me.

"truth1ness","B000UVKZXQ","I don't understand all the bad reviews. I've gotten two boxes of 24 packs and every one so far has tasted great. They're obviously not going to taste like fresh shelled chestnuts right off a roaster, no more than canned peas are going to taste like fresh sweet peas picked from the plant on the farm. If you can handle canned peas I don't know how you couldn't handle these. They're a nice filling healthy snack. They're good alone but I usually mix them in with my meals. They go great with so many dishes as they add some sweet nutty taste to the dish.Half these reviews are complaining simply that they are 'slimy' and they threw them out even though they tasted, smelled, and looked fine. I don't know how you can throw away five pounds of food like that. What canned vegetable isn't like this? The only difference is they put water into canned peas etc so the vegetable 'slime' is diluted. What do you think the gooey water is that comes out of a can of beans? Any food product with enough water content will be like this, it's the nature of chestnuts not unsafe packaging. They obviously can't pack roasted chestnuts in water like beans and peas or they'd be ruined. Just rinse them off if it bothers you that much.Yes, the inside of the package is moist, that's because chestnuts are a moist food product! Unless you know of a package that can stop all evaporation inside itself, the shelled chestnuts are going to be moist. And no, the moisture doesn't mean it's moldy and will kill your family (unless you leave it opened for a week like one reviewer, seriously?). If it did then every canned and pouched product would be lethal.

"JDNM","B000V1AWBU","The curry is good but not great. It is indeed ""restaurant quality"" at a three or four star Indian eatery but it doesn't deserve five stars.A couple of caveats. First, my experience is that this curry doesn't hold up well to extended cooking. I used in it a slow-cooker recipe and after about three hours on low all the minor notes in the curry were cooked off and it was basically chili. Having said that, cooking it on simmer for 40 minutes on the stove top as the package directions stated worked perfectly. Second, it is worth pointing out that each packet contains 2800mg of salt which is a lot even for a prepared item; that's 125% of the RDA from just a single packet.I'd buy this item again but because of the high salt content I ration how much of it I eat at one time.","4.0","Better than I expected but extremely high in salt.","1356307200"

The odds of you getting a dented can seem very high. And im sure that if there is lead in the lining, that denting the can will only make it leech even more.its really a shame that there isnt an american company canning and selling these figs! c'mon american companies , get with the program!taste and texture wise they are great. They come with too much sugar syrup in the can, but if you drain them and give them a bath in pure water you can get most of the sugar to come off, so thats fixable. If there is lead leeching into the fruit though, that isnt fixable, or acceptable. I cant confirm or deny at this time that there is definatly lead, but I personally dont trust canned foods from any country outside of the usa.I know you can get lead toxicity from eating canned foods with lead lined cans, because I used to eat alot of canned papaya that was canned in tailand. I did a hair test a few months after eating tons of canned papaya, and the hair test showed me 23 times the normal limit of lead. Then i got a lead test kit to test the can and sure enough it was lead posative.im going to try to order another lead test kit and see if I can test these cans again myself, and maybe if I can get that done ill update this review with those results .meantime I have 2 more cans already ordered and shipped, and I guess I cant cancel or return them now and im gonna be stuck with the lead! I dont intend to eat them anytime soon, if ever. Id suggest severely limiting the amount of figs that you eat at once, if you do decide to eat them.","1.0","Caution! warning - vital info before you order, make sure you know its packaged in china and could contain lead","1295654400"

After years in the market, for Monsanto Roundup ready soy geneticists found ~600 extra genes that were not from the soy or the roundup gene, this means there was scrambled genes left behind. A single inserted gene can change the entire genome, measurements show around 20% of the genome changed by a single insertion. Genetic modified bacteria producing L-Tryptophan killed dozens and injured hundreds. RUN from products like this that are poisonous to your children. There is a reason our health in the USA has degraded since GMO's were unleashed! As if the GMO is not bad enough, the crop is sprayed with Roundup dangerous chemical poison, a dynamic double poison brought to you by Monsanto. Canada's FDA said that the BST trials from Monsanto provided to the FDA for acceptance were enough to have it refused and that the FDA regulators who approved it were INCOMPETENT! So much for the BS safety trials of Monsanto. The Monsanto people running trials on BST milk refused to drink their product!

"csm","B000VK3ZGA","Overall, if you're looking for a low-acid, ""he-man"" coffee, then be SURE to grab this!  It's quite amazing the difference this low acid coffee can make to your stomach and I could even drink the entire pot of the stuff! Normally, I take coffee completely black, no additives whatsoever.  But, with this french roast, it's quite strong.  REALLY strong and definitely, less is better in the pot. If you're a fan of Starbuck's Verona coffee and have no trouble drinking that stuff black, this is your best bet for a low acid coffee.  Combined with cream and sugar, then no problem.I tried this coffee just wondering if I could really tell the difference between regular and low acid coffee.  There IS a difference! The flavor is quite good but doesn't end smoothly like oh, say, Folger's might, but this is a gourmet coffee and will carry a stronger punch than a commercial coffee like Folger's will.  I plan on trying a different roast too since my tastes are more towards a full-bodied coffee instead of the kind that tastes like it was made in Texas during the Wild West days!  This ends a bit rough, kinda like the Starbuck's Verona, not as smoothly as I would prefer.  I made it with bottled water, not tap, to get the full flavor and aroma, so keep that in mind when deciding on which flavor to choose.  I am going to continue to play with this flavor to see if I can get it to suit my tastes better.  If you try it and it's too strong, then I suggest you dump the pot onto your roses!  Makes them quite gorgeous, actually!This is a great product, particularly if you're looking for the low acid variety.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better low-acid coffee out there.  But, if you're like me and prefer a more smooth, well-rounded roast, then I suggest you try one of the other roasts.

Most coffees, I need to add non-fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non-fat.I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.

Every other organic or natural coconut oil I've tried has a very light, clean taste of coconut with maybe a little sweetness to it. This Gold Label type has a stronger taste, and not one I associate with fresh coconut. It's OK for cooking meat or vegetables, but I would not use it for any foods where I wanted a sweet taste (like on a sweet potato or in a fruit pie). I'm kind of baffled by the Amazon reviews of this oil in the 32 oz size which say it's bland and doesn't have as much taste as other coconut oils. Less coconut taste maybe, but overall the flavor is stronger. To me anyway. It's possible that since the product is hand made, the flavor may not be consistent between batches. I'm on my second jar and the first jar was so strong I thought there might be something wrong with it.Gold Label Coconut Oil is made by a very unique process. Most other brands of organic coconut oil I've used have been cold expeller pressed in a machine that squeezes the oil from the coconut while controlling the temperature so it doesn't heat up and ""cook"" the oil. The Gold Label coconut oil is made by hand. From the Tropical Traditions website:""The fresh coconut meat is shredded (wet milled), and then cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconuts to make coconut milk. The milk is then allowed to sit for about half a day, while the oil naturally separates from the heavier water. The oil is then filtered from the curds (coconut solids).""More info at the Tropical Traditions website at [...]I give this oil extra credit because it's a unique product -- I don't know of any other coconut oil being sold which is made by hand using traditional methods.

I think it's OK, but for the price you pay, I would rather it would have been sweeter.  It tastes great spread over pancakes since you also pour syrup on the pancakes, but in the future I won't buy it again.

"AJ","B000XEV9YE","Bought this as a coffee replacement / substitute and very happy. Caffeine wise you are looking at 2:1 ratio with coffee (I drink strong coffee) to get the same effect i.e. 2 cups tea for every 1 cup of coffee.  If you drink weak coffee you may be satisfied with a 1:1 ratio.  There is another tea with more caffeine called PG Tips.  Brews bitter the longer it steeps.As far as flavor, it a subtle malty flavor and brews to an amber brown.  Great tea.Yorkshire: good caffeine, great flavor, can be bitterPG Tips: great caffeine, ok flavor, not bitter, may need lemon/milk/sugar/etc","5.0","Really great tea.

It does not lose that golden color and it is particularly nice made iced with honey.

I would generally want coffee with caffeine but with this tasting so good, I did not miss it.If you want a good cup of coffee without worrying about the up or down effects of caffeine then this would be an excellent choice.

"Spyce","B000YVOHBI","Okay, I'll admit, I am not a fan of instant coffee, however, it makes a tasty iced coffee drink.  Using two sticks and 12 ounces of water, I add a cinnamon stick to 6 ounces of water before placing the cup in the microwave to heat. Once it's heated, I add the coffee, remove the cinnamon stick, and add sugar and a splash of cream.  I then pour it over ice in another glass with the remaining 6 ounces of water.I recently added a coffee cookbook to my collection but hadn't tried any of the recipes because they use instant coffee which is something I rarely use, and I was reluctant to buy any because I knew it would go stale before I used it up. These little packs have solved that problem.  Tonight I made a coffee walnut cake using a recipe from my cookbook, and it is delicious with a nice light coffee flavor.These coffee sticks are a great idea, and I will probably use these more to cook and bake with rather than drink.  They are convenient, and the individually wrapped sticks will work much better for me than having to buy a jar of instant coffee which loses a lot of flavor within a couple of months of being opened.I'm reviewing a trial offer, but I will definitely buy this product, and I recommend it.","5.0","Great Idea!","1217462400"

"Cher","B000ZK5NV6","I ordered these hoping to bring back a GOOD childhood memory, and it almost does. When I was little,  some 50 plus years ago, my grandfather used to take me to a small mom and pop grocer, every Saturday morning.  They had two large oak barrels (on each side of the cash register), the barrels were filled with salt brine pickles. They had both garlic brine and dill brine pickles; my grandfather would let me choose one of these salty delights on each visit.  For a nickle, I would get one of these large salty/sour pickles, and of course I would always choose the biggest one that I could see. (These pickles were huge, a good pound, I have never seen pickles that large since.)This product reminds me a bit of those pickles, at least taste wise. The pickles are not even 1/5 as big as those of my memory, which is OK; they are also a bit softer, and not quite as crunchy.  Sadly, there is NO dill in these, which was my favorite. These are garlic flavored. (The mom and pop store had both garlic and dill brine pickles, and I would alternate between the two at each visit; but the DILL was really my favorite.) These have a bit of a ""metal"" taste, I assume from the can. I miss the earthy-wood taste that came from the oak barrels that they use to use; but all in all,these are not bad. (Another thing I miss is the strong pungent sour smell of the pickles when the oak wood lid was lifted, and the thick SALT ring that used to coat the top edge of the barrel; but NOT missing the smell and the salt ring is NOT as important as the the taste. And as I said, these are not to bad and they do bring back a good memory.)The cans in my order arrived a bit dented, I don't know if they were dented before they were shipped or if the dents happened during shipping.  The case of pickles was shipped with other items in a large box; there was nothing around them to prevent movement during shipping.  So I suspect that the dents happened during the shipment. (The box is was shipped in was huge, it must have been difficult for carrier to handle it without dropping it.  There ware signs, externally. that it had been dropped.)Anyway, if you like salt brine pickles, you will like these. But if you must watch your salt intake, these are NOT for you, there is a lot of salt.  And these  will increase your water retention, blood pressure, kidney stress... but you may well think the risk is worth it.","4.0","Not bad for the price, they brought back a good memory, despite not being quite the same as those of my past.","1372723200"
"nonpareil","B000ZSX4D2","Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not ""blanched"" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of ""lightly salted"" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be ""Pasteurized"", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a ""light"" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says ""BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14"". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent.

I'm real happy about the probiotics included too.I couldn't find the scoop in the tub when I opened it so I called the company to find out how many teaspoons equaled the 8 gm dosage and they had me on hold a long time trying to figure this out.

You can also mix small amounts of it with water and spices to create a coconut-based curry sauce.My only complaint really has nothing to do with quality and probably can't be fixed. During shipping or even storing in room temp cabinets, the product does separate into two layers, one soft and oily, and one hard and dry. To get it out of the plastic interior pouch, I have to cut the pouch open and scrape it down with a spatula to get all the product out. And because it has separated, it needs to be heated or melted in order to emulsify it. This isn't a big deal when I'm using the whole package for something, but if I only want to use part of it, the remainder has to go into a storage container in the fridge, where it separates once again. I'm not sure how many times it is ok to reheat this product.Again, I believe this is just the nature of creamed coconut without additives in it, so I'm saying all that just so people know how the product behaves.

"Ghenghis","B0011CX2M4","Its koshering salt, not really ""Kosher"" and it has not been blessed by aRabbi in a clean room in Haifa or somewhere, this is the salt used in thekoshering process to extract the last drops of blood from cured meats.Whats different between Diamond Crystal and Morton's? Well for one thingthere are no fillers or caking agents, and Morton's is ground rock salt,much coarser and less willing to dissolve than the fine flakes you findwith Diamond Crystal. Also DC is distinct from other kosher salts becauseof its extraordinary texture that easily crumbles between fingertips, itssmooth blendability and its exceptional adherence. Diamond Crystal is puresalt and has no additives.Ask any chef why they use kosher salt and they will tell you it tends tohave a clean, natural flavor and sprinkles more evenly than other salts.Also, this DC is half as saline as table salt by volume, while Morton's is2/3 as saline as table salt by volume. That means there is less probabilityof over-salting. The general usage table looks like this: 2 parts table salt= 3 parts Morton kosher = 4 parts Diamond Crystal kosher.Anyway, if you go to diamondcrystalsalt(dot)com under the Culinary tab you willfind the store locator for your area. Also on the website is a highly entertainingand informative ""Salt 101"" by Food Network's Alton Brown that will explain to youwhy you should be using Diamond Crystal Kosher, and how. Never understood whyDC is generally found in the kosher foods section of the grocery stores, while theMorton salt is in the spice aisle?This DC product was also awarded the American Culinary Federation Seal of Approval,which basically means this is the #1 choice of gourmets everywhere.

"Muttley","B0012690UC","I purchased this item only once before moving on to bulk buying another brand. Compared to buying bulk, for sure, this 5 ounce can comes more expensive, however it is still good purchase when compared with similar sized alternatives. It came in a retro-style red metal box with a plastic top. Unlike some other reviewers, we have experienced no bugs or webs or any other nasty stuff in it. It was fine ground and of decent quality.The top has two openings: for faster and slower flow rate. I found them difficult to operate since they both had pretty stiff lids and for many occasions, opening those lids was a torture so I ended up removing the top all together and taking it by a spoon. I think It should have been designed better.About the taste: As I commented in the headline, it tastes sweeter compared to other paprika brands I used, it is okay but I can not say it has a prominent flavor so I am neutral about the taste, you may find that you need to put more paprika than the recipe asks for to get the same effect.It is a nice purchase,especially when bought through the subscribe and save program (offering up to 20% from the list price) however as I said, I can not say it is outstanding and if you are a massive paprika user, like myself, this size may not be appropriate for your needs.","4.0","fine ground and a little on the sweet side.","1402272000"

The idea is to use mix 1 whenever you find yourself pressed for time and may otherwise find it difficult to break away for a good, slow-food meal.mix 1 resembles a yogurt drink in its taste, texture and aroma. Testing the drink, I found mix 1 to be agreeable although not particularly appealing. But one should keep in mind that the emphasis here is on nutrition, and there is no doubt that mix 1 tastes better than many others I have tasted that intend to compete in this product category.The ingredients include whey protein, organic cane sugar, juice concentrates, and olive oil. mix 1 is free of lactose, gluten, soy and caffeine. mix 1 is also fortified with 23 vitamins and minerals. Consequently, the drink leaves out a lot of the bad and delivers a lot of the good in a small package.

"Grace","B0013TJB7A","This flavorful, easy-to-chew beef jerky is also fun to eat.  The good thing is that there's not too much of it in each pack, which forces one to limit his/her intake. Even so, each pack has 24% daily value of protein.  Pretty good!  This is American style beef jerky - drier than the asian counterparts.  However, rather than being overly sweet, it has a nice, smokey taste that combines well with the spices.  The spiciness level is mild, I'd say.  Nothing the average snacker can't handle.  I recommend this brand of beef jerky.","5.0","A tasty and nutritional snack, actually snack-sized!","1240272000"

Grass-fed beef steaks are noticeably better in comparison, so this jerky should be better, right?  Not so much.The taste is about average for packaged jerky.  The ""Grass-fed"" portion, if you're thinking this is supposed to be healthier...it's not.  The ingredients include both MSG and sodium nitrite, which even in competitor products aren't always found.Full ingredients:Beef, water, sugar, salt, black pepper, soy sauce (water, wheat, soy, and salt), smoke flavoring, hydrolyzed soy protein, garlic powder, maltodextrin, onion powder, soybean oil, MSG, silicon dioxide, flavoring, glycol propylene, paprika, sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite.Not really something that sounds all that appetizing.But, if it relaxes your nerves for safe food, it's a product of Brazil, and even has the official inspection stamp:  Ministerio Da Agricultura BRASIL Inspecionado 3673.At any rate, the stuff isn't bad, it's just not better than the rest - as far as the ingredients go, it's probably a bit below average.  If you're after the best jerky overall, you'll want to check out Stewart's Meat Market.  If you're looking for the best packaged jerky and this is an option - flip a coin (or read the ingredients list, and get the one with fewest chemicals.)

"Kendra","B0014WYXQK","This review is for the grapefruit flavor, but I've tried clementine and pomegranate, too.I'm continually surprised at what passes for ""healthy"".  I received this product to review but was already familiar with Izze sodas, as they're available at most Starbucks and now at grocery stores, as well.These are 8.4 oz cans and each can is 90 calories.  Since nutritional data isn't included in the item description, I'll include them here.Each 8.4 oz serving has 10 mg sodium, 20 gm carbohydrates, and 20 grams of sugar.So, for those who believe this is a ""healthy"" alternative to sodas, I would disagree.  An 8-oz serving of Caffeine-free Coca Cola Classic has 97 calories, 27 grams of carbohydrates, 33 gm sodium, 24 grams of sugar.So, really, having an Izze isn't such a healthy alternative to having a coke.  You aren't reducing your sugar intake with an Izze nor will you reduce your carb intake.  Yes, it's juice and ""natural"" but your body responds to sugar and carbs quite the same whether the sugar comes from juice or another source.The sugars that come from juice is fructose-- and your body responds to fructose the same way it responds to table sugar.  They both cause your insulin levels to increase.  Each 8 oz glass of juice has about 8 full teaspoons of sugar.  So, if this 8.4 oz can of Izze soda is made up of 70% juice, you are still consuming 5.8 teaspoons of sugar.Whole fruit is much healthier than juice since the fiber has not been stripped away.  Fiber moderates the release of the sugar in your bloodstream and moderates the insulin release.Sorry for the nutrition lesson.Izze sodas TASTE good-- and even this Grapefruit (and I don't care for grapefruit) tastes good.  As long as one understands they aren't having something ""healthy"" when they have this sparkling juice, great-- if it's just taste you are looking for, give this a try.  Sometimes, though, a pretty label and a spot on a shelf in the Organic Food store causes people to believe that what they are consuming is healthy when, in fact, it's just not.I received a case of 24 cans.  My family enjoys Izze sparkling juices because they taste good and, because we have them, I don't mind them drinking them.  Even though I will occasionally purchase Izze juices for my children when we're out and hit Starbucks, I never buy sugary drinks at the store.  I consider these sparkling juices to be empty calories. When this supply is through, we won't buy them again to keep at home.4 stars for taste.","4.0","Seems like a healthy choice. . . but, it's really not.","1209427200"
"Malvin","B0014WYXQK","Izze Beverages offers a variety of aromatic and refreshing line of drinks that are healthier and better-tasting alternative to soft drinks. Consisting of all natural ingredients (70% juice and sparkling water) and with no added sugars or caffeine, Izze's drinks are simply a better choice for you and your body. With a creative blend of juice concentrates -- for example, the pomegranate drink consists of apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate juice -- the taste experience is far, far superior to almost any drink you'll be likely to find in your local vending machine.Interestingly, Izze is packaged in 8.4 fluid ounce cans. A trade-off in using natural fruit juices is higher calorie content, so perhaps the tall, slim design of the can and its smaller volume is intended to help offset, both psychologically and materially, the reality of consuming an 80 calorie drink.However, Izze does not fare as well with competitive products from R.W. Knudsen whose drinks are made with 100% juice and are offered in 12 fluid ounce cans for about the same price as Izze. But perhaps more tellingly, Knudsen does not feel compelled to fortify their drinks with needless vitamins nor do they wear their corporate philanthropy on their sleeves to the extent that Izze feels compelled to do. One wonders if all this might be due to Pepsi's acquisition of Izze in 2006; the benefit of Pepsi's sales and distribution network might have come at the cost of marketing hyperbole and the production of a slightly less desirable product.Still, Izze shows that the soft drink industry is on the right track. If you normally consume artifically-sweetened soft drinks, choosing to enjoy the unique taste experience of Izze's all-natural product line (with delicious specialty flavors such as grapefruit and pomegranate) should be an easy decision for you to make. But if you are a little more finicky and prefer an 100% juice drink, you might also look into some of the other alternatives that are available to you.","3.0","Far superior to your local vending machine","1209254400"

"eyecore","B001534QYW","The can reads as a gigantic billboard of overzealous claims.  The ingredients are conspicuously lacking sugar and high fructose corn syrup (a good thing.)  The idea behind the product - a fairly natural drink packed with various herbs and such is pretty good...except for the overdose of caffeine is apparently the selling point of this product.The flavor is unbearable.  When it first hits your tongue, it tastes pretty much like a Sobe drink:  not great, but pleasantly mild in the ""sweet"" department.  Once the first gulp is swallowed...you don't want to take another swig.  It basically tastes like some kind of massively fortified energy/vitamin powder you'd buy at some vitamin shop that advertised a ""pleasant fruity taste,"" but upon actually using human senses, it's quite repulsive.  This is a bit better than the vitamin powder, but I can't imagine anyone enjoying the taste.Also, the reason it burns so many calories is likely because it's going to leave your heart thumping uncontrollably due to the incredible dose of caffeine.  Also of important note, the ""clinical studies"" that ""prove"" that this stuff works were all funded by the company.  No conflicts of interest there.Would not recommend to anyone.  Exercise will increase your metabolism without the jittery side effects (or heart attack, if you want to go that far), and if you really must use an energy drink...there are others on the market that won't have you burning calories due to the gag reflex.","2.0","Might work as advertised...if you can stomach it.","1269216000"

"naturegirl","B0016AZH4M","I loved these fennel seeds. They were big, fresh, lively, beautiful, sweetly aromatic--just so nice (nothing like the store-bought varieties, which are so dried up and small, with only a faint lingering smell of fennel). Seeing a big 1 lb bag of beautiful, fresh fennel seeds sitting in my pantry, I remembered to use them for their medicinal benefits too, and, after a meal with a particular potential for upset, opened the bag and scooped a heaping spoonful of fennel seeds into a mug and poured some hot water over them, then let them sit, covered, for a few minutes. The tea worked like a charm, and I bypassed the usual bloatiness and etc that went with that particular meal (those old, dried up seeds I'd been using all along barely comforted my stomach at all, and I always just assumed it could've been much worse if I hadn't bothered to make the tea at all--these actually WORKED). The tea was incredibly tasty too, and breathing in the vapors was so pleasant and relaxing. I plan on trying them out in dukkah, a very nice Egyptian spice mix a good friend got me hooked on (and this particular brand's fennel seeds come all the way from Egypt, which will make it all the more authentic and special). My one tiny peeve was the bag these came in, as the plastic zip completely detached from the bag even while it was being very carefully opened (it's now folded down with a tiny binder clip on the end). Thankfully, the thoughtful folks at Starwest Botanicals slipped the spice bag into a larger, heftier zip lock bag with a better zip, so I wouldn't have any problem with the seeds spilling out anyway. When these are all gone, I'll be ordering another bagful from Starwest via Amazon, as these are not only the freshest and best quality, but also incredibly economical and much more eco-friendly, considering the cost and waste of those tiny little store-bought  glass bottles with the plastic caps that I'll never have to buy again. Save your container of store-bought fennel when you're done with it, then use this product as a refill. You'll be so happy you did.

"Cordelia","B0016B9FSU","My husband has spoken often of the health benefits of coconut oil and cooks with it often. He has used a variety of brands. However, the tropical, coconut-y smell and taste of each of them put me off from using coconut oil for most recipes. Coconut goes well with Indian cuisine for example, but in many other recipes the taste was discordant. I was thrilled to receive a jar of this product which has NO taste or smell, the first I have come across. You can use this oil knowing it will not impart any unwanted coconut aura to your cooking!I also noticed, when sauteeing with this oil, the food did not seem to absorb as much of the oil. With canola and other oils, I often have to add more oil to the pan as it gets absorbed by the food, but that did not happen with this coconut oil. The meat was perfectly and evenly browned without soaking up all the oil. So, while coconut oil may cost more than others, a little goes a long way in cooking, and the food does not become saturated with it.The lack of taste is also helpful for those who take coconut oil orally for its health benefits but find the usual coconut flavor cloying.","4.0","At Last, A Flavorless Coconut Oil","1356825600"

The Aztecs called this ""the food of the Gods"" and it truly is...incredibly healthy and full of vitamins, protein, antioxidants and it's extremely filling.

I got these chips (multigrain and the cheddar flavors) simply because I saw good ol' quinoa in the ingredient list but also tons of other good stuff: Stone Ground Yellow Corn, Non-hydrogenated Canola Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Flax Seeds, Turbinado Cane Sugar, Oat Fiber, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Quinoa, Soy Flour, Sea Salt, real cheese in the cheddar.But having ""good"" ingredients doesn't often equate to good taste.It does here.

Of course, not having an overpowering flavor is a good thing...Texture is important with the foods I eat, and these had a nice firm crispness to them.

"Rachel","B001AY8VV0","First of all, my cats had no problem with these flakes at first.  That's important to note.  And, I stored them properly, per the instructions on the bag.  But after awhile (perhaps because they were around for a long time), my cats started to get sick after eating them.  Here's my story - and then you can decide whether you think you want to feed your cats these flakes or not:Although these flakes are for human consumption, the ingredient (100% Bonito Tuna Flakes) is identical to that in other tuna flakes I've purchased for my cats.  Given the huge cost savings buying these, I thought they were a great deal, and my two cats didn't seem to notice a difference.  They ate the flakes as their nightly treat for a month, then another, and into another ....  Eventually, my cats started to get sick nearly every night or near morning. At first, I thought one or both were going through a ""hairball"" period and tried their hairball treats.  Nope, that didn't do the trick.  Then I considered their food and pulled back a new kibble I had added to their regular diet given they both had dental care done a few weeks back.  No change.  So, on to the vet we went to make sure the problem wasn't a side effect of their dental procedures (e.g., infection, some other problem).  Nope - my cats were otherwise healthy.But the problem persisted and was becoming a real issue: I was tired of seeing them miserable (in the times I saw them during the time they were sick) and I was tired of buying (and using!) SpotShot to clean carpet stains.  Finally, in desperation, I did the only other thing I could think of - I stopped giving them their tuna flakes.  They weren't happy.  They cried at night.  I live in a rural area and was patiently awaiting the next order of tuna flakes for cats (paid for 1-day shipping, but didn't order until late on a Saturday afternoon - alas!)  Here's the amazing thing: the nightly vomiting stopped. When the new flakes arrived (from a company I used before, who also sells flakes in volume, although about 1/3 the volume of this bag), I carefully started to give them their nightly treat again.  No problem at all.  They've been fine since.I'm not a scientist.  I can't conclusively state the flakes made my cats sick or at what point the flakes became too old to be safe for my cats.  These flakes are labelled as for human consumption, but the ingredient is the same as what is in cat tuna flakes (although I thought these flakes might be a touch ""smokier"" in scent).  But what happened is enough for me.  I won't be buying these anymore.  Not worth it.  My kitties and I are back to a happy nightly feeding schedule with their old flakes and no problems!","1.0","please read - made my cats sick (or so it seems)","1351296000"

"Bud","B001BM62T4","First, the technical:  It comes in attractive packaging with a good Ziploc seal that actually works.  I really had high hopes for this and give them an A+ for effort.When you open it, however, you clearly realize this has nothing to do with espresso.  There is a super-fine, orange-red dust that comes out almost like smoke and gets all over things.  Next, the texture of the tea is not small flat-like crushed leaves like normal tea, but smallish woody/grassy splinter-shaped material.  It definitely does not tamp like espresso.  Also, being a tea, it does not brew like espresso.  It seems to take about 1-1/2 shots of water to extract the tea.  For a double-shot, this is 3 ounces or more (in 2 passes).  Next, the tea expands into a relatively hard puck more like particle board.  You will have to do some real banging to dislodge it from the portafilter.  I wound up using a fork which furthers the mess.  The fines also got stuck (a bit) in the screen.  Thus, I found the whole ""espresso"" brewing process a bit of a farce.Next, the taste.  It does create a nice crema which is sort of surprising.  The aroma and taste remind me distinctly of Thai tea.  The taste is about 1/2 Thai tea and half wood/sawdust.  I personally did not like it and could only finish about 2/3 of a mug (with steamed milk).  I personally would rather just buy Thai tea which is available from a local Asian store for $2 or $3 a pound and brew it in a standard drip coffee pot.  I think this tastes better, is less mess, and is vastly cheaper.  If you've every used Thai tea, you'll recognize the orange-red spice/dust that tends to get all over.I would have given it 1 star, but my wife absolutely loved it.  Maybe it was the novelty or maybe it was that it was like Thai tea, but she really liked it.  Given the price, though, it might not be an every-day type of tea.  I would recommend that if you are familiar with Thai tea and like the taste, then stick with it.  If not, give this a try.  It's worth a shot just for the experience.","3.0","Polar likes/dislikes in our house","1244419200"

When Ireturned to New York and tasted this Iliada at a restaurant, I immediately bought a bottle. It seemed easy enough tofind in NY, but now that I'm back home I'm glad to know I can find it online.This seems reasonably priced (maybe around $13 or so) for a large bottle and since I don't cook with it, I feel it lastslong enough so isn't overpriced. I store it in a pantry as olive oil is supposed to be in a dark place. I also learnedin Sicily to look for the date on the bottle as you don't want to use oil that's more than a year old.The taste is just lovely - with a light sweetness that makes it a great partner for bread.

It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy.

I thought I'd give these a try but I really didn't enjoy it as much.The banana and mango or whatever were good, but the banana slices themselves seemed almost slimy to the touch, probably just the oils from the other fruits mixed in with it.  Still tasted fine, it was just an odd texture.The prunes though... they were okay but I bit into one and nearly broke a tooth on a huge chunk of pit left behind.  I spit that out and then as I continued to chew, nearly cut the roof of my mouth on what I assume was a broken bit of the pit that was really sharp.So, I gave up on the prunes after that.  I'm too chicken to eat them now, and besides, they did a number on my digestive system a few hours later, if you know what I mean.  That may be part of the point for some people though.I won't be getting these again... they're probably fine for some folks who like that kind of thing, and I'm glad I tried it because it seems like it should be a healthy snack, but I enjoyed the fruit bits even more and I'll stick with those.","3.0","Not bad, but ""mechanically pitted"" means you'll still have pits","1398297600"
"Marcon","B001E530J8","Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with 'Yuban Original' coffee! I usually go through a 33oz (refrigerated) can in about 2 weeks time. For me, the last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one.  There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something 'better' out there, but it's usually at a higher price. Although the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.PRICE UPDATE:Having previously used ""Subscribe & Save"" option, I have paid as little as $11.64 (less than $0.18 / oz) and as much as $21.64 (almost $0.33 / oz) - that was before the subscription was discontinued - by Amazon. Now it's back! With the return of ""Subscribe & Save"" for the Yuban Original 33 oz cans, the price has dipped back into that range at $19.21 ($0.29 / oz). The price may vary but this is still a great cup, so I'm back on board . . . for now.","3.0","Consistently Delicious (with wide price range)","1297123200"

The taste of the fruit is bland; you really have to struggle to find any apricot flavor at all.  Worse, my sensitive tounge noticed sulfur overtones.  Furthermore, these apricots are not really dried; they are really soft and mushy.  You will notice right away if you are used to dried peaches or apples.  Finally, I thought that it was odd that in this day and age they did not come in a resealable container.These might have a use in adding color to a salad.  But overall I cannot  rate them highly.

"Bud","B001E5E2RC","Do NOT buy this product.  Although Amazon is showing the Classic Hazelnut flavor, they are shipping the regular Hazelnut flavor.  The regular flavor is terrible and tastes like 1/2 peanut butter.I wish Torani would stop messing with their flavors and/or test them with someone who can taste.  This tastes nothing like hazelnut.  It tastes like some kind of sweet chemical caramel flavor dominated by an off peanut butter taste.If you want the REAL hazelnut taste, look for ""Classic"" Hazelnut.  Unfortunately, you cannot trust Amazon to ship you the right version.

I thought it was me just getting used to it, but it is not.  I have become very frustrated with Torani's tampering with and reformulating their syrups.  Even compared to their ""sugar-ful"" syrup, I find that I have to use almost twice as much of this product.  I have found a similar story with other Torani Sugar-Free syrups.  It seems they are making up for the trivial cost of the artificial sweetener and giving you less.As a result, I have been trying many other sugar-free (and sugar-ful) syrups -- and spending a lot, too.  In comparison, Monin O'Free chocolate syrup is roughly 2X as flavorful/concentrated, but sadly, it is about 2X as much cost.  Plus, you may have to pay S/H.  While the Torani flavor is pretty good (slight chemical taste), the Monin is a bit malty, so I would give the Torani the edge.  I have also tried DaVinci's sugar-free chocolate syrup.  It probably has the best taste, but like Torani, it is watered down.  DaVinci's is a bit more on the bittersweet side.  At twice the cost, however, it is hard to justify when a bottle only lasts about a week (> $1 per big mug of coffee).Hopefully, others can post what good sugar-free syrups they find.  I hope my review and comparison was helpful.","3.0","Very bland, but priced OK, and taste just OK","1283817600"

"xenofan","B001E6EJQU","I saw these advertised on TV a couple of months back, and finally got around to giving them a try only last week.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I normally just buy the non-frosted variety of mini-wheats, but find myself having to add so much sugar to them in order to make them edible that it ends up being a very unhealthy breakfast.  Whilst the frosted strawberry delight mini-wheats do have about 10g of sugar per serving, I figure that I'm still getting less sugar at breakfast than I would if I were adding it myself.  So it actually works out as a healthier alternative for me.I can see why many people might find this product too sweet, but for me, it's just about right.  I don't like too much sweetness with my cereal at breakfast time, but neither do I like things too bland.  The mini-wheats are fairly evenly flavored, and whilst they don't really taste all that much of strawberry, they do taste sweet and nicely fruity.Be warned that these will send your milk pink, though!  The pink coloring might be a bit off-putting to some people, but it doesn't really bother me.A single serving size is about 24 wheat pieces, which is more than enough for me at breakfast.  Then again though, I do not have a particularly big appetite-especially not at breakfast-and others might find the amount a little lacking.My husband rather enjoys eating these as a snack, without milk.  In fact, he's almost consumed half a box already just by ""grazing"" whenever he goes into the kitchen.  I can't complain too much though-at least it's getting him his daily fiber allowance!  I don't really enjoy these without milk.  I find eating them to be too much like eating sugared straw.  Even when I add my milk, I always like to wait a few minutes for them to soften before I start eating.In finishing then, these are pretty good, so long as you're willing to accept that their so-called ""strawberry flavor"" isn't all that strong.  If you're looking for a healthier breakfast choice, this probably isn't for you, since the sugar content is quite high (and doesn't include milk!).","4.0","I like these","1312156800"

The pasta turns out just right, and the sauce is pretty good too. The Rotini with Zesty Marinara Sauce has a nice, garlicy zing to it. The portion size is just right for an entree; it is a little small if it's comprising your entire meal, but if you're eating at your desk, chances are you didn't have time for a full meal anyway. The plastic handles on the bowl stay cool enough to make it easy to transport this to your desk; no more trying to find the tepid spot on a flaming hot piece of microwaved cardboard so you can goose-walk it down the hall before your fingers burn.A couple of things lowered my rating by one star: for one, there is a bit more sodium than I'm entirely comfortable with in a product aimed at the health conscious, 600mg. Two, there's quite a bit of plastic packaging with this meal.

"Bill","B001ELLC9C","Made some almond cookies using this paste, wicked good! Used a recipe from King Arthur Flour.com, can of almond paste, sugar or sucralose, eggwhite, dash of salt, maybe some chocolate chips, yummo! This recipe only yields 12-15 cookies, and kind of pricey, but well worth the effort/expense. Crunchy on the outside, deliciously chewy almond inside.The paste needs to be cut up with a knife in smaller pieces, before putting it in a food processor, as it is thick and will bog down the processor.Free ship took 4 days from order date. Packaged well.The paste is obviously expensive, but is also very tasty. Great stuff.","5.0","Almond paste","1315612800"

"nicole","B001EO5Q64","This double pack was a terrific deal (~$10) compared to local stores. I bought this product mainly to moisturize my very dry skin and it works wonders! It does not leave the skin feeling greasy compared to other products (e.g. jojoba oil) and is much more economical. I enjoy the very natural smell of coconut when I first use it on the skin, but the smell dissipates shortly afterwards. Cooking with it is like cooking with canola oil - it does not impart a coconut taste to the final dish. Use oils in moderation, including coconut. One jar is used for cooking and the other is kept in the bathroom as part of my beauty routine.

"nonpareil","B001EO5Q64","I've learned that coconut oil trumps olive oil when needed for saut&eacute;ing as this has a higher smoke point thus doesn't break down at fry temperatures. So I bought two jars and it looks as though that's none too much. Cuz right away I learned it has a lovely aroma and taste and gives that extra flavor boost. I had cooked a large acorn squash then mashed it right into the cooking water so it was semi-soupy and had enough that I needed to vary it for different meals. I flaked about a teaspoon of this (solid) coconut oil into about a cup of squash the first night, then spiced with cumin and heated in the microwave. The natural sweetness of the squash was complemented by the coconut flavor and of course the cumin jazzed it more. The next night I again added the coconut oil into the same amount of squash but this time stirred in about 3 tablespoons of sour cream and spiced the dish with Ras El Hanout and corrected the salt. Again yummy and was transported to someplace on another continent. The coconut flavor really makes a difference.I have a little project going making cosmetics, especially face and body creams.

It really is amazing, and would be awesome at your next brunch, right alongside some awesome blueberry muffins.You don't get this overwhelming taste of blueberry either - just a hint at the end that blossoms in your mouth after swallowing.  Kinda like a good wine, to be exact.  It really is like drinking a regular cup of coffee along with a muffin, but without the extra calories.  If you're adding cream and sugar, you're in for a delectable treat.

"nonpareil","B001EO682A","This almond flour totally MADE my new Danish rice pudding recipe!(Adaptation from Risalamande or Ris a la mande, a traditional Danish holiday rice dessert.) Heat 2 cups water (or skim milk for better taste but more difficulty with sticking to pan), add 3 tablespoons tapioca, 1/2 cup rice, 1/3 cup raisins, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, a dash of salt, stir frequently while bringing to gentle boil. Reduce heat to barely a simmer, cook for 45 minutes or until rice is completely tender. Remove from heat and fold in 1/2 cup almond flour. OK to serve with cream or whipped cream but without is lower calorie.Well, it's still a work-in-progress. I tasted the pudding prior to installation of the NOW Foods Almond Flour and it was sort of blah. Then after stirring in the almond flour and !YES! - it gained an absolutely wonderful nutty flavor. The traditional recipe calls for almond slivers but that isn't what I wanted. This is. BTW the traditional recipe also calls for a fruit sauce topping, usually cherry. But I'm working on higher protein, lower carbohydrate diet.I keep this almond flour in the fridge because I know that nuts with their high oil content can go rancid.

It tasted more like regular coffee than anything else and for the price, I expected their usual great taste.  The vanilla biscotti is quite hard to beat so I thought this one would stand up close to that one.  Chocolate is quite good in the Folger's too so you might want to give that a try.  If you're a fan of flavored coffees, go ahead and try this with cream and sugar.  It might work for you, but if you're like me and prefer the more flavored versions, you'll have to add some of International's caramel-flavored creamer to get the full flavor of this version.","4.0","Good, but not their best","1320192000"

Also, the whole nuts seem smaller than the whole roasted cashews that Costco sells for about the same price. Finally, the Planters cashews are noticably saltier than the Costco cashews. I'm not opposed to salt for health reasons, but that much salt does mask the natural taste of the nuts (and taste is why I bought cashews instead of peanuts).","2.0","disappointing","1303948800"

In addition, the pieces I tried were very very tough and cut with the grain rather than against the grain.I didn't enjoy it too much at all, but my 11 year old son enjoyed it quite a bit and finished the bag.  He isn't too particular, though, and hasn't had any beef jerky that he's disliked so much he wouldn't finish it.Recommended if you don't have a particular brand that you compare all beef jerky to and if you find this one at a reasonable price.The best jerky ever is World Kitchens Brown Sugar Beef Jerky, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2).

"ephemeral","B001FA1SSM","The box claims this cereal is ""100% natural"", and indeed a quick look at the ingredient list shows a relatively small list of basic ingredients.  In addition to the wheat/barley flakes, there are also dried strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries, and a whole host of natural sweeteners, including honey, grape juice, brown sugar, and cane juice.  While all those sweeteners (and the fruit) give the cereal a very nice taste, it also means that a large percentage of what you're eating is sugar, albeit natural sugars.  The box says 17g in a 55g serving are sugar- a little high for my preferences.  Also, because the cereal is all natural, there are no added vitamins and minerals, which are so prevalent in fortified cereals.  As a result, you'll have to look elsewhere in your diet to meet all your needs.This cereal tastes very sweet, and the texture isn't bad.  So if you're looking for a good-tasting, natural cereal, I'd say this is a solid option.  If you're more interested in a cereal that will serve as a balanced meal, you should probably look for another product.","4.0","tastes good, but it might not be the healthiest breakfast choice","1230854400"

The flavor is absolutely delicious, but the texture of the flakes have the same rigidity and CRUNCH of the original ""Grape Nuts.""  (Of course, ""Grape Nuts"" had no flavor except whatever cardboard flavor they managed to leech from the box they were in, but that's another story.)Basically, if somebody is talking to you while you're enjoying a mouthful of this cereal, you won't be able to hear them over the crunching - but you won't care much, because you'll be savoring the flavor and not paying attention to them anyway.","4.0","Delicious cereal with a VERY hearty CRUNCH.","1230422400"

And if you go only by the packaging and name and don't look at the nutritional information, you may be able to delude yourself that you're eating healthily, too.Problem is, this cereal is loaded with sugar and calories.  At 17 grams of sugar and 210 calories, it packs quite a wallop.  That's about 4 tsp. of sugar in one cup.  As a comparison, Lucky Charms has 13 grams of sugar and 120 calories.  Back to Nature Summer Berry Blend does have more good stuff, like fiber, and no corn syrup.  And, some of those 17 grams of sugar come from the dried fruit, which is big and plentiful.  Still, that's roughly 1/2 the recommended daily allowance of sugar.The fruit is very tart, and IMO competed jarringly with the intense sweetness of the flakes.  Also, it has to be eaten quickly or it turns slimy.  If it is eaten quickly, it has a freeze-dried quality, so take your pick.  I, personally, gave the fruit to the kids (who loved it) and savored the oh-so-sweet-and-crunchy goodness of the flakes.Next time I fall off the wagon, though, I think I'll minimize the sugar and calorie damage and go for the Lucky Charms.","3.0","Delicious, but healthy?","1232582400"

"naturegirl","B001FVNM3A","I started using nigella, both in seed and oil form, a couple of months ago. I may not be able to notice all of the benefits yet, but I can say that most of my more severe digestive issues have been soothed considerably. I also wanted to share, for anyone who is about to try it, that the seeds can have quite a bite to them. Some websites have described it as ""peppery,"" but it is not exactly peppery in the sense that black, white, or cayenne is. It has a bite to it similar to what raw, shelled hemp seeds have, or raw coconut oil, and leaves you a feeling in the back of your throat and palate that can be a bit itchy and raw. When I first started taking about a teaspoon a day, I was grinding them as finely as I could in my food processor. They are a bit hard for my processor, though, so even if run for quite a long time in the grind setting, it merely crushed some of them into a powder and most remained whole. I tried mixing the now expanded spoonful with a bit of honey, but it it did go down kind of raw, making me think I might be having an allergic reaction to it. I googled ""nigella allergy"" and all I could find was that it might help for allergies, but not that it could cause them. So I tried grinding a spoonful as much as possible and mixing it with coconut water to drink, but it still wet down kind of itchy (it took a little while for that raw feeling to go away both times). Finally, I came across the recommendation online of making a tea out of it, and so I boiled some water and poured it into a mug over a spoonful and drank it when it cooled. I was fine with the tea, and even chewed up all the seeds in the bottom of the cup afterwards. It still went down a bit itchy and raw, but not as much as having the seeds raw. I have still not come across any articles on the web that would explain my reaction as being an allergy, but I have come across more and more benefits, and so I am continuing to take it and will be purchasing more of it. I would love to know, though, if anyone else has had a similar experience after chewing the seeds? I am taking nigella oil as well and it does go down the tiniest bit itchy, like raw coconut oil does, but not so much as the seeds. Also, if you take it consistently, the rawness seems to go away, then returns if you stop taking it for a while. I welcome any suggestions from more experienced users on how to best prepare and take the seeds, specially, but also the oil.","4.0","has a bit of a bite to it","1383868800"

"Muttley","B001GVIS4M","I am of Mediterranean origin and yogurt is a key element of our cuisine. We consume 1/3 gallon of yogurt everyday and eat it with almost every dish. That is why we make our yogurt daily and never buy it from outside. Home made yogurt is a kind of tradition in our house that has passed many generations. I have tried various cultures as starter but for the last couple of years I rely on this one.First of all, key to making thick yogurt lies in the technique rather than the culture. All you need is to warm the milk in moderate heat up to 185 F which is very close to scalding. You should keep an eye on the milk as it can get burnt leaving you a nasty pan to clean and a burn taste in your final product or overflow which again is a mess. But this should not discourage you since if you keep the heat in moderate setting and/or mix it a few times during heating it should not be difficult to guess where to stop even if you do not have a thermometer (I strongly recommend buying one for accuracy and consistency)The purpose of initial heating is not killing the bugs like many people believe. Even if you use pasteurized milk which I do, this initial heat is necessary to get a thick end-product since that high temperature denatures the milk proteins and makes it easier for helpful bugs to work on them.Next step you allow it to cool down to around 110 F  or to the level that you can barely touch with your finger. That temperature is ideal for the growth of thermophilic (heat loving) bacteria and this starter contains those type.Then you add one sachet to one liter of this pre-treated (heated and cooled) milk and after thoroughly mixing you immediately cover it and incubate. If you are using a yogurt maker 5-6 hours of incubation should be adequate (for those starting from this culture) if you do not have a yogurt maker then cover it with blankets ( a few sets) or various cloths to keep the internal heat (traditional technique I had used for many years before buying a yogurt maker) This time the incubation time depends on the external temperature, how  you cover it  and the volume of your milk. But around the same time should be fineTraditionally people in my home country use pre-made yogurt as a starter culture and they even borrow culture from neighbors when they need to change it. A store bought yogurt could be a replacement for using a starter culture sachet like this one but in the long run, this comes cheaper than buying yogurt from the grocery every once in a while and is more convenient since it can be stored for a long time at a cool-dry place with no need for refrigeration.I use my previous yogurt as the starter culture for the next one. 2 table spoons in one liter of milk is more than enough, and that way the incubating time can be significantly reduced compared to using starter  culture like this one. For example, using  yogurt maker, I incubate the yogurt made from a previous yogurt for 4 hours to get the desired thickness. Under same conditions it takes 5-6 hours to get the same density when starting from this powder.However using previous yogurt as starter, the efficiency goes off in time while the acidity increases due to other colonies finding their way to the medium. If you keep everything clean and store your yogurt in closed containers in the fridge then this cycle should last around 45 days until you need to start a fresh cycle from this powder.That is how I get this one order last for a year without sacrificing from the quality. Therefore I rate this as a 5 star product due to the price and the convenience it offers. I hope this tips help the other home yogurt makers save some money, remember: yogurt has been made for thousands of years and using starter culture is only a thing of the last few decades...Note: I useT-fal YG232BUS Balanced Living Yogurt Maker with LCD Timer, WhiteandUpdate International THFR-17 5 1/2""-Long Dial Frothing Thermometerduring the procedure I explained above. I can recommend both products for those who need one.","5.0","this 9 pack  box can last you almost a year even if you make yogurt daily...","1404691200"

"audrey","B001H3201Q","Interestingly, I see some reviews say there is no chocolate taste here, and others say there is no caramel taste, so I really put some zen-like intensity into this taste test.  Life is good.Individual caramel-swirled chocolates, wrapped in pleasantly crinkly thin tin foil, are around an inch and a half long and very very short -- about the thickness of an Andes mint.  It is a bit too large to nestle on the tongue or in the roof of your mouth comfortably, or to flip about for that matter.  So my beef is with the physical design; if you're going for a smooth melty chocolate, you should make it a pleasant lingering shape.I have no problems with the candy itself, however.  The flavor and texture are  lovely -- very chocolate-y, very caramel-y and very smooth, so it melts beautifully, giving a sustained intense flavor for those with the self-discipline not to bite.  Biters will enjoy these too, if you don't want a hard snap.  If you appreciate Lindt and Ice Cubes, you will really love these.  It is not a toffee or a hard candy of any kind.  It is soft and melty.Now on matters of nutrition I try to be a pragmatist.  And if I'm eating chocolate I don't expect to be introducing a health food to the system.  But reading the back of the Werther pouch doesn't make you very happy about partaking.  A serving size of 6 pieces docks you 230 calories and 16 g of fat (10 g saturated, 0 g trans), 10 mg cholesterol and 50 mg sodium.  If you could make yourself stop at 2 or 3 it wouldn't be SO bad .... and look at the bright side -- each serving ALSO gives you 6% of your iron and calcium.

"AlisonA","B001HTI708","I've tried a lot of different coconut milks over the years, and this by FAR is the thickest stuff EVER. The solids at the top of the can are usually 2&#34; thick or more. I also appreciate that there are no additives, especially guar gum, which has a most unpleasant gassy and laxative effect on my system. Sorry if that's TMI, but some of you may be wondering why you get an upset stomach after eating coconut milk ice cream or coconut curries - check for guar gum in your coconut milk.In any event, I've reordered a couple of times, and the product is consistent. At least two or three cans seems to be dented in each shipment, but it's never affected the quality of the product inside.","5.0","Thick and delicious!","1390867200"

It is the perfect medium blend and the taste is rich, suberb and totally satisfying.  Great for the morning pick me up or any other time of day.  But coffee is getting expensive.  The large containers of all brands used to come in 39 oz sizes.  Then they went down to 33 ounces for the same price.  Now many are going down to this new 22 ounce size.  I am amazed in the stores at the high price of coffee now.  This Folgers coffee here on Amazon is an amazing deal for price and quality of coffee when you use subscribe and save.  You get three canisters, a total of 66 ounces, for $19.49.  It comes out even cheaper to what two 33 ounce used to cost in the store.  And my local store just had this 22 ounce size on sale for $8.99. For 3 that's $8 more than this great Amazon deal.This review is definitely about the superb Folgers coffee though.  I must add that I also find the 22 ounce size very user friendly for the coffee stays fresh longer due to the smaller size.  Same amount of coffee in 3 canisters rather than 2 for the same price.  But as always there are some sellers on here trying to rip the buyer off when Amazon is out of stock.  No coffee is worth the ridiculous prices some will charge.  $47 for this?  Be real.  Just be certain to purchase it from the ever reliable Amazon themselves and you will be getting the best coffee out there at an unbeatable price.

Fantastic, for example, in your morning smoothies. And you can sneak it in on your spouse or kids without them even knowing they are consuming something healthy...even in, for example, a milkshake they ask you to make.  Hey, at least it adds SOME nutritional benefit.  But stir it in applesauce or yogurt and you get even more.Here's a breakdown of what hemp can do for you:Heart Health and Lowered Blood Pressure:Clinical studies indicate that hemp products reduce inflammation and improve circulation, factors of primary importance in the cure and prevention of many diseases. My own improved within 2 months of daily use in my smoothies without any other changes.Improved Digestion: Have been shown to assist in chronic digestive issues. Because many today are on gluten-free diets, they may not get the fiber they need daily through their diet.  Hemp can assist in added fiber to the diet, along with the added protein and other benefits it naturally offers.Losing Weight Naturally: Hemp seeds make all meals more filling and have been shown to reduce cravings for sugar and starches. A double whammy.Increased Energy: Natural energy without stimulants such as sugar or caffeine.Healthy Cholesterol Levels: Hemp protein is cholesterol free, but contains the optimum ratio of thepolyunsaturated essential fatty acids, Omega 3 and 6 - hemp oil contains 57% linoleic (LA) and 19% linolenic (LNA) acids. When added to the diet, in a whole, natural and a cold processed food, like hemp protein improves cholesterol profiles. Hemp oil also contains some GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) that is absent from the fats we normally eat, but considered to be beneficial to health by nutritional experts.A Natural Way to Control Blood Sugars: The first steps in naturally balancing blood sugars is to introduce a high quality lean protein in your diet - the glucagon released when you eat protein helps keep insulin in check, then incorporate essential fatty acids, both of which are within the hemp seed.  By avoiding refined carbohydrates - sugars and starches, in favour of high fibre vegetable and whole grain foods, you can naturally not only control your blood sugar, but reduce cravings because of it. Diabetics especially, report that circulation improves.","5.0","Add to your smoothies, eggs, shakes, soups, yogurts for a health powerhouse and even weight loss","1390262400"

It is very nice to be able to drink it without the artificial sweeteners, and corn syrups. That was definitely pleasant.This drink is carbonated, which brings the juice to life! It is amazing what carbonation can do! However, I have to say, it is not overly carbonated like many sodas out there. It is very nicely carbonated so it gives the drink some zing, but doesn't leave you feeling like the bubbles are overwhelming the drink itself!The flavor and the drink itself are very good. However, the small cans (8.3 ounces each) seem a little small. I can see a small container for an energy or vitamin drink, but for a juice, it left me wanting a little more here. I certainly would have liked to have larger containers, rather than many small containers.If you like to drink juice, and don't like that sugary feeling afterwards, give this drink a try!

"cb","B001LG945O","My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.","3.0","Was not a hit at our house...","1235692800"
"ephemeral","B001LG945O","I really liked this drink.  It provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly-sweet, sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind.

Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.

"jpr","B001LG945O","So far I've only tried the Orange Tangerine flavor and it's pretty good overall.  It does have a tangerine taste to it, though it's accompanied by other flavors.  It's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange/tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If they're sticking with aluminum cans, I'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and I'll likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time.","4.0","Very good, could be a bit better.","1246320000"
"jt","B001LG945O","As advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink.  The taste is similar to Orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth  feel.  It actually leaves a thick taste in your mouth similar to when you drink orange juice from concentrate.  It is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits (again, similar to real orange juice) as there are no added sugars.

It tastes ""fresh,"" for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink - not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a ""cleaner"" flavor that the sugary/corn-syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.

"Grace","B001M0AKWA","As the title states, the main fault with this oatmeal is the artificial maple flavor. It's slight, but leaves an odd taste in my mouth. I mean, oatmeal is healthy and good in itself; why add that extra artificial sugar if it detracts from the overall taste of the food? In this case brown sugar would have been enough. Or at least use real maple syrup.Texture and consistency is up to you, based on how much water you put in and how long you cook it. I put in different amounts of water and I thought the oatmeal tasted best with more water. My guess is that the water diluted the strong sugary taste so that it was more palatable to me. I still give this product 4 stars, because most flavored instant oatmeal have this issue of using artificial ingredients that affect the taste.Ultimately, after trying different kinds of flavored instant oatmeal from various companies, I think I enjoy plain oatmeal with dried or fresh berries the most.

If they were to take out the other additives and decrease the sugar, that would be good, too.By the way, don't pour in boiling water like it says on the package--not unless you and your kids enjoy eating cereal the consistency of wallpaper paste or soggy sawdust! It works much better to add cold water to the powder and then microwave the two together for a minute or so. I also find that pouring in a packet of plain instant oatmeal provides more fiber, gives the cereal just about the right sweetness, and fills me up.","4.0","My favorite of Quaker's instant flavors, but it has some issues","1359072000"

My baby probably doesn't know the difference, but to me the texture is soggy and chewy. 2) They don't taste like anything. Yes, I know I wanted less sugar but I assumed they'd taste like something! I bought the apple variety, so perhaps another flavor would be more interesting but these seriously taste like nothing.  3) the top doesn't stay closed very well.

"ephemeral","B001OCBT3U","Granola bars tend to fall into two categories: dry and tasteless or overly sugary and sickly-sweet.  Luckily, this peanut granola bar doesn't fit into either of those categories.  It's overflowing with peanuts and peanut butter, so it definitely has a strong flavor, but it isn't too sweet.  It was chewy but not dry, and it didn't leave my fingers sticky or oily, like so many snack bars do.  My only complaint was that the crisped rice part of the bar seemed to taste a little funny, but I'm not a big fan of crisped rice at the best of times, so it's probably the normal taste.  With 220 calories, 110 fat calories, 7g of protein, and only 7 g of sugar, it's not a treat that will make you feel guilty or unhealthy for the rest of the day, but you probably wouldn't want to down 4 or 5 of them in one sitting either.","4.0","Nice Alternative to Sugary Treats","1248825600"

For one thing, even though Kraft's mocha flavored granola bar has one percent more daily fiber than a Fiber One bar, the saturated fat content is higher.  Also, there doesn't seem to be much granola in this granola bar; instead, it's covered in chocolate and...I think a peanut butter/mocha flavored strip with the consistency of whipped frosting.  Though I don't taste anything new here, except more sugar, the bars don't taste too bad.  However, I would still take Fiber One over South Beach, as the saturated fat level is pretty high, and the size of the bar is smaller.

"eyecore","B001OCKIBY","I wasn't sure what to expect with these - they aren't granola bars, they aren't candy bars...  Of course, they're ""NUT BARS.""  Triple Nut, to be exact.  (The package also says ""5 Chewy Granola Bars."")  ""Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, and Cashews.""Well...they sorta taste like a dirty Payday candy bar, except the ""peanut"" flavor tasted like the bad peanut that you end up getting in every bag - a bit bitter or over roasted but pretty gross either way.  I couldn't taste any almonds or cashews (perhaps because they're the the 13th and 14th ingredients.)  They ""honey roasting"" is sort of a misnomer, as the sweetness is undoubtedly coming from the Corn Syrup (ingredient #2), Sugar (#4, #10), and Evaporated Cane Juice Inverted Syrup (#11.)  In fact, honey is listed as the 4th ingredient under the ""contains less than 1.5% of"" list.At any rate, a Payday candy bar tastes better, and just by claiming these are ""NUT BARS"" doesn't really make them healthy...comparing the nutrition facts between these and a Payday reveal these have a less sugar, more salt, and the same protein.Given they're being marketed as granola bars and healthier than candy bars...these are on the very bottom of my list for flavor and texture of a granola bar.  If you're looking for a good, healthy, chewy granola bar...you'd be much better off withCascadian Farms Organic Chewy Granola Bar, Chocolate Chip, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).  If you're looking for a snack with nuts - just buy the nuts.I'm not sure why all the other reviews seem to be raving about these things...I generally eat only natural and/or organic foods, so perhaps my palate just drastically varies.For reference, here's the full ingredient list:Peanuts, Corn syrup, Crisped Rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols), peanut butter, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, whole grain rolled oats, almonds, cashews, [Contains 1.5% or less than:]  Whey (from milk), soy lecithin, salt, honey, vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed), resistant corn dextrin, Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain rolled wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran), xanthan gum, and more mixed tocopherols.","2.0","Wow, these are pretty gross.","1245715200"

It is a wonderful blend of both with a nice honey flavor.I enjoyed these bars and find them to be a useful snack when I am a little hungry, but don't have time to eat yet.

It's 30 percent larger than the leading nut and granola bar and provides 7 grams of protein per bar. Available in two varieties - Double Peanut (with crunchy peanuts and chewy peanut butter) and Triple Nut (with honey roasted peanuts, almonds and cashews).I don't normally like eating healthy, nutrituous items, but sometimes a snack can't always be chocolates and cookies! So I tried the new Planters BIG Nut Bars...it is not that big compared to say, most candy bars. The main reason I don't like granola bars is because they are hard! I have good teeth, but I fear chipping a tooth when biting into most granola bars filled with the nuts and dried fruits and caramalized coatings...so I was slightly hesitant to try Planter's...but I'm GLAD I did --- they are delicious!Not only is the first bite easy, but all the nuts still have that fresh crunchiness to them. One of the tests that I do when I want to get a granola/candy bar, is the squeeze the outside packaging, if the bar is too hard, forget it! If it's too soft, forget it! But this has the perfect squeeziness to it.The taste is of a Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds and Cashews, and yes, I definitely am tasting those together. It's a good mix and best of all, healthy! I always remember in the news and food books, they recommend eating a small bowl or handful of nuts before your meal so that it helps fill you up a bit (and you'll eat less) and that's the nuts contain alot of protein and such goodies for your body.So yes, it's a good snack, tastes good, is healthy --- recommended!","5.0","Nutty goodness!","1245888000"

It says the bar is 30% bigger than the leading nut and granola bar, but since I don't know which one that would be, I have to say I don't think these are particularly large.

But there were also pieces that were too big to be topping.  So I used them both as finger food and a yogurt topping.  I find that alone, it's a little too sweet, and as a yogurt topping, it's nothing special.  However, it's not a bad snack, because it uses some good ingredients and the dark chocolate helps add extra taste.  In other words, this is a light, fun, and tasty snack that won't put you back too  many fat calories, and provides some nutritious benefits as well.

I received this item as part of the Vine program, so I had no idea how much it cost. One true test of an item is to think how much you would pay for it, and THEN check to see what it sells for.

"jpr","B001OCKIP0","I do have a soft spot for chocolate, but I like something a little more sophisticated than, say cocoa puffs, not to mention a little more nutritious.  I've tried Special K Chocolatey Delight, which I liked, but I have this habit of occasionally checking the nutrition facts. I found out why they call it ""chocolatey"" rather than ""chocolate.""  The bits in the Special K are mostly sugar and partially hydrogenated oil.  That cereal is also sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and preserved with BHT.  It has some other added vitamins, but I don't really understand the benefit of adding those to cereal vs. just taking a supplement if needed, or better yet eating more foods that contain them naturally.In comparison, I see that this granola has ""real"" chocolate chunks, is sweetened with evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, contains no trans-fatty acids, and uses only vitamin E as a preservative.  It also has 4g fiber per serving, vs. 1g.  That doesn't magically turn it into health food, in fact this granola has more total sugar and fat per serving that the Special K, but given the choice between the two it still clearly wins on ingredient quality.As for the taste, I like it.  It's simple, without too much going on, and it's sweet enough to satisfy the sweet tooth without going overboard.  The amount of chocolate is just about right as well; enough to find some in most every bite.Overall I'd say it's a pretty good choice to stifle a morning chocolate craving as long as you stick to a reasonably sized serving.  I'll almost certainly be getting some more, especially if I find it on sale.","4.0","Tasty and with good quality ingredients.","1243641600"

The reason I say this is that it isn't that sweet which is really nice.  The chocolate is a semi-sweet and the granola is lightly sweetened.  It is somewhat hard to eat because the pieces don't clump together (probably because there isn't a lot of added sugar).  I tried eating it while walking on a golf course and it was tough.  The granola is almost airy when chewing.  I would probably be good eating like cereal.  I usually put granola in my yogurt but, wouldn't do that with this chocolate chip one.

I really didn't want a chocolate flavored cereal, so I was planning on enjoying this as an eat out of the bag snack, but the melted chocolate makes it messy.

"River","B001OI5VTW","The box says it's a ""full-bodied, caffeine-free alternative to coffee."" I wouldn't say it's an alternative to coffee, but it really is a very tasty and unique tea. When I first opened a box, all I could smell was cinnamon, which made me think I was going to hate this tea. As soon as I poured hot water into my mug, the smell changed completely and so did my expectations. The cinnamon scent wasn't as dominant as it was when the tea bag was dry, and there was a wonderful chicory scent that gave me hope. The hint of allspice and star anise compliment this tea perfectly without overpowering it. It tastes like nothing I've ever drank before, and even though it doesn't taste much like coffee to me, I like it so much that I drink a cup almost every day.The only reason that it doesn't get five stars is because it's a bit weak for my taste, and one bag is only strong enough for a small cup. If I want to drink a big mug I need to use two bags. Let it steep for five minutes before you drink it, which helps get the most flavor out of it. I personally do not need to add sugar to this tea, the cinnamon, carob, and star anise make it somewhat sweet.My favorite way to enjoy a good cup of Roastaroma is with a cinnamon or almond flavored treat, like a cinnamon roll or almond blondies. I find that these flavors compliment the tea perfecly.The ingredients are not listed on this page, so here they are in case you're curious: Roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, cinnamon, allspice and Chinese star anise.","4.0","Wonderful tea, but not really a coffee substitute","1346112000"

"anton2g","B001P1YOGE","I have to start by saying this truffle salt is a fantastic deal. It is really wonderful on some things. Stuff like popcorn, eggs, and butter it works perfectly on. A few other things like potatoes and more heavily flavored things, the truffle does not really come out. There is not enough truffle in this salt to truly flavor some foods without making them too salty.Also get a different container to pour this salt into, because once you open it, your whole cabinet will smell of truffles. The container it comes in is not very airtight.I recommend getting this salt for simple things, but getting another more 'truffly' (and pricier) salt for more heavy foods.","4.0","Good truffle salt for somethings, not the best I have had.","1337817600"

Well, the size is great and the package opens up easily, and as fat as the product is concerned it is pretty good as well.However, I would say that you need to give it a few packs as once your taste bud adjust to the flavor you might really like it...  We use to be fans of Justin's, but after trying out Barney's we will definitely not be switching back. Barney's has become our new stand-by, yet once again I must say that if your taste bud are use to another type Barney's might come off on the wrong.

Amazon definitely has the best price, but it's still pricey., the local whole foods market sells these jars at $13 each, that's absurd! hopefully more people will discover what they've been missing out and Almond butter will be as common as peanut butter on store shelves, maybe it will help bring down the price.. still too expensive to eat this as frequently as i eat peanut butter, so i can't completely replace my peanut butter just yet.Tip: i mix this with my morning smoothies.. 1/2 cup oats, 1 frozen banana, 2tbps almond butter, 3/4 scoop of vanilla whey, 1 tbsp flax or chia seeds, 1 cup of skim milk. taste so good. for a snack i'll put 2 tbsp almond butter on a potato roll (almost zero fat, 8g protein) and it goes down with a cup of skim milk. easy, healthy and 25g protein!","5.0","The best alterative to peanut butter","1373846400"

"Ghenghis","B001SB03SO","Tabasco has done what very few in this space have been able to manage. They have engineered a habanero elixir for the extreme palate that tastes good on just about everything, and I do mean everything.I've got over 50 different brands of hot sauce in my collection and this jewel from Tabasco has pretty much obsoleted all of them. It's got a mild island flavor reminiscent of a jerk/calypso sauce and it's guaranteed to make everything from bar-b-que to hamburgers to collard greens to bloody marys and even salads tastes better. It doesn't have that sting regular Tabasco has that hasn't been properly aged, but it will bite you, and it will bite you hard if you're not judicious with the amount you're pouring on. The best thing about this sauce is that is commercially available just about everywhere.Warning - This stuff is addictive. After a couple of weeks on this juice you'll get the ""hot sauce slobbers"" every time you walk through your grocery's butcher shop. Don't say I didn't warn you. 5 Scovies!","5.0","This is the one you'll keep coming back to.","1297296000"

A British tea, it just is packed full of flavor, doesn't look like dish water in your cup, and is a beautiful golden hue packed with smooth, not bitter tea. What a wonderful surprise!  It even holds up to milk and sugar without losing any of that tea taste.  Is ANYONE from Lipton reading this?  Theirs has been ruined, in my book.

On this last batch I decided to put another 1/8 cup in &#34;whole&#34; for texture...So I used 50% more than I had with the starwest product, and I was expecting an intense anise aroma when I was done.I got NOTHING, I might as well of not put anise in at all, there was NO anise aroma coming off the biscotti as I baked them, and after cutting and cooling....After storing them in a bag over night I opened it & thought it has to be more aromatic today..... nope... again NOTHING, seriously it was like I never used the anise. (When I used the starwest anise I would open the bag to a VERY strong aroma of anise.)Based on the other reviews... for uses, other than baking, I guess its fine... and I have purchased more than a few products from fronteer, in the past (and its been great), but this time not at all, at least for this application.Im going to toss it in the trash, and order a couple of bags of the starwest product.... fyi if you are considering using this for biscotti","1.0","Very disappointed!","1397865600"

It's got 244 kcal, which is great for someone looking for a decent-sized snack.  The drink is a little thick, and it is much more filling than juice or a sports drink.  The taste is a little strange.  It starts out tasting a little metalic, but after a sip or two it just tastes vaguely like vanilla. I can't help wondering if the strange beginning taste might be due to the probiotic straw.  Apparently they've placed helpful bacteria inside the straw.  It seems like a bit of a gimmick to me.

"Cher","B001XSMANI","I ordered one of these for myself, then I went back and ordered two more for gifts.  The two in the second order were sticky and stuck together and to the sides of the container. I believe there was some moisture inside when they were sealed, but I am not sure. I decided to open and check one of the containers and I discovered that they were indeed sticky. They tasted fine, but it was disappointing, since I bought them as gifts.  I didn't feel comfortable in giving them as gifts because they were sticky to the fingers,stuck together, and sticking to the sides of the container.  I didn't want to open the second one at that time; I knew I would find the same thing just by looking at the candy stuck to the sides of the container, so I decided to wait and open it later.ADDITION:  When I finely open the second container, I was right, it was the same as the last one.  My grand-kids and I have had allot more candy in the last few months, far more than any of us needed. Of course we haven't finished all 40 lbs yet, but I assume we will in another month or so, I hate to let things go to waste, and because this candy is damp, even with all of the SUGAR in it, I worry about mold or bacteria growing if it is not eaten, sooner rather than later. I found that if I left it in the big container, the stickiness only got worse once it was opened.  It seems that each time you opened the container the candy drew more moisture form the air. (If you buy this and it is sticky or starts to become sticky, try storing the candy in smaller plastic containers and pop the plastic lid to remove any excess air form inside. I also put a small piece of tin foil in the center on top, and on the tin foil I placed a cracker to help pull the  moisture from the candy. It worked for me.)Anyway, with all of the above, I thought I might order another (again as a gift) despite the last experience that I had with the two that I ordered. (The first that I had ordered was fine.) However, I noted a jump in price of $4.00 and I noted (at least at this visit to the site) that it cost more to subscribe than to order just once.  I sent a ""note"" to the company, asking why it cost more to subscribe than to buy it once.  I hope they fix this issue for the better by lowering the subscription price,rather than raising the one time price.  Anyway, at this time, I prefer to look for a lower price elsewhere, rather than order here and now.  I seem to remember seeing elsewhere for pennies more than what I paid the last time I bought these.I like Amazon so I always come here first when I am ready to buy something, but after seeing the price, I think I will go back and look for that other site, I noticed a few weeks ago.  I am on a very limited budget, and every penny counts.FYI: Some of the reasons I like Amazon is when something is wrong with my order, or a third party order, they go out of the way to fix it or help to resolve it with another party, whether it be a shipping issue, damage, a wrong order...  Their prices are comparable with other online sites. Finally, they don't use or require PAYPAL as a method of payment ONLY.EDIT:  When I started buying this the were $19 and change, the last time $20 and change, NOW they are over $26 this is far to much, I will no longer be buying these here.I have noted an increase in cost (a large increase) of Amazon items and their 3rd party sellers. I NO longer use Amazon as my primary shopping site, which is sad because I really like their customer service. (NOT so much the service of the 3rd party sellers, which I have found to be rude and dismissive in MOST CASES, NOT ALL.)  But the raise in the product cost, makes me rethink each item and before I buy, I look elsewhere online, before I will purchase from them, it sad but ture.","4.0","Last two orders were sticky, maybe moisture inside????","1340150400"

Having purchased two quantities of a multipack (3 each), and being folks who like to stow things away to enjoy later rather than devour all at once, we had forced ourselves to reserve one of the packs of 3 tins, and just recently brought them out to enjoy again. As luck would have it, we found a worm in that last pack. Refusing to believe what I was seeing, I turned the first one over thinking it must be a nerve or some other such body part, but no--there was the accordioned midriff and the clitellum and every gross part I remembered from the dissections back in school. Not only that, but  (after deciding to dump it all on a paper plate to gift to the stray cats out back), I found 6 more--for a total of 7 worms in one small tin of cod livers (please see my snapshot, above).

Stevia is far sweeter than sugar or artificial sweeteners so it will just be ""too much"" pouring it in your mouth or tasting it straight. However, on food or in coffee it's excellent.I would have thought there isn't much more to say on that until I recently tried Stevia in the Raw and felt it bad enough to write a comparison review.Do I think Truvia is too expensive? Yes. Why can't a competitor surface and charge less? I haven't yet found one.I thought I had but then found that Stevia in the Raw is not raw--it's mixed with Dextrose which is a form of glucose. Then I found that a box of 50 packets of Stevia in the Raw weighs 1.75 ounces whereas a box of Truvia weighs 4.9. This wouldn't matter except for there really isn't nearly enough Stevia in the Raw in one packet to sweeten anything. They truly gave you WAY less in every packet to make the price seem better in getting 50 packets. Put 1/4 of the amount in every packet and you have to use 4 packs of Stevia in the Raw to equal one packet of Truvia.Come on people...bring on a real competitor.

There is no reason to add egg whites to pasta, but I am assuming they've done this to promote the *good source of protein* advertisement. We all need protein but it comes in many forms and it comes plentiful in plant based foods, there is no need to eat meat to build up your protein sources.It does take longer to cook because of this fact, at least 4-5 minutes longer than regular pasta.

"Charlotte","B0026ZYZ7Q","My best friend is from Saudi Arabia, and I have come to love the evening tradition of ""Gulf Tea"" or ""Arabic Tea"" and sugary dates every evening at sunset at her house. The scent of cardamom fills the entire home during the brewing of that tea. I purchased this Numi Cardamom Pu'erh to see if it was anything like the Arabic/Gulf Tea of my best friend's home.This is like a version of Arabic Tea more suited to an American palette, with the stronger sweet flavor of the Pu'erh dominating and a mild, pleasant flavor of green cardamom. When making a single cup, the aroma will not fill the house, but the scent of that one cup is enough to ""take you back"" and reminds easily of this comfort food tradition.I would recommend this tea to anyone who likes cardamom and pu'erh, as it is a delightful and mild combination of both. While everyone recommends this tea to brighten your morning, I also highly suggest trying it after dinner, as it will help your meal digest and provide a soothing calm to welcome the evening.Amazon - When are you going to start selling the Saudi-style, vacuum-packed ""sugary"" (Barhi) dates?

Then I remembered that Pu-erh always smells a bit funky, and so I put a lid on my mug and let it sit for a few minutes, until the vapors had dripped back in and my mug was not scorching to handle. Then I uncovered it and took a deep breath in of a lovely, earthy, gently spicy cup of goodness that made me go ""that's what I'm talking about...""

"Pamela","B0026ZYZ7Q","I like the taste of cardamom, so I was happy to try out this tea.  I hadn't had pu'erh before, so I wasn't sure what to expect of the tea itself, but I really enjoyed it.  The cardamom isn't overpowering, which can happen with the stronger spice, and it lent a delicate sort of spicy-sweetness to the tea, which was bold and smooth.  I can't find the caffeine content of this particular tea, and pu'erh teas have widely varied amounts of caffeine depending on the leaf type, so I'm sticking to this one in the morning only.  I didn't get jumpy when drinking it, but I'd rather sub it for my usual morning tea on days when I want something spicier.","5.0","Delicious blend of bold and delicate!","1362182400"

Numi Organix Pu'erh Tea (Cardamom flavor) tastes very similar to your favorite Chai Spice tea, but with a more defining flavor.

"Chandler","B0029XDZFS","I acutally used to be a salesrep for Aramark and sold ONLY coffee to large corporations. Because of that, I had to learn the beans inside and out and so much else about coffee taste.That's no longer my career, but I still search out good beans for my own morning wake up call.This is one of my favorites.Coffee beans break down in taste via 2 main elements: light and oxygenFRESHNESS: The individual cups, therefore, prevent you opening up a bag daily and exposing your beans to what ruins the taste and freshness each time you open the bag: light and oxygen. This is a good and brilliant thing with the Keurig because you can use cups like these that remained sealed rather than one individual bag that gets opened each day. . Individual cups mean they are opened but once. Total freshness.TASTE: But none of that matters if the taste of the coffee isn't great to start. And this is. I'm still picky about a rich, full-bodied roast with my eggs each day. This is soothingly wonderful and  is a staple in our kitchen.

There just isn't that smooth follow-up that you're expecting.  Intead, you get a wave of ""bite"" at the end, with a bit of the acid taste that Starbucks promotes.

"LD","B002ACU9XY","My husband has been ""Decaf"" for 20 years.  So for 20 years he has searched for a Decaf that tastes like REAL coffee.  We use a Senseo Supreme (chrome look) coffee pod machine with 16 strength settings depending on pod holder, LED brew strenth, and cup size selections you use on the machine.After a 20 year search the Baronet 100% Columbian medium roast brought a smile back to his face.  I use regular full roasts and I prefer the Baronet Izzy medium roast and also like the Baronet French Vannila pods. (more of a 'chick' blend)  But do not let that fool you.  If you want a bold coffee the dark or bold Baronet brands that our younger friends prefer are 'truck driver' approved.  We keep them on hand for guests so buy the variety pack or a simple Dark Roast.These pods will work in your Senseo however if you buy the pods in the foil packs that come in the box (stay fresher) they are larger and you may need to use the 2 pod holder with a single pod if you have the black machine.  However, one pod will 'mash' down ok in the one pod holder of the Supreme Senseo machine.  Yes, that wonderfull foam froth is still there. Pods that come loose, 18 to a package, are the same size as the Senseo pods.","5.0","True coffee taste","1340409600"

"J","B002AQL00G","I purchased Betty Crocker's Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix from my local Wal-Mart and was super excited to try them, as I just recently went gluten free and haven't found a good cookie yet.They were easy to make, just like ""normal"" cookies, and the house smelled wonderful while they were cooking. I almost cried when I took the first bite because they were SO GOOD!! They were perfect, warm, and soft in the middle with a little crispy around the edges. I couldn't have asked for a better cookie!However, when I pulled one out the next day to have another cookie, I was so sad to see it crumble in my hand. I had to pick up the crumbs and throw most of them away as they were so dry I couldn't eat them. They just kind of dissolved when I picked them up and didn't hold together.All in all, these cookies are WONDERFUL straight out of the oven, but they seem to really dry out when they cool and are pretty useless as decent cookies afterward. I may buy this mix again, only if I have enough people to eat all of them straight out of the oven. I won't make them for myself, though, as I'll end up throwing away 75% of the cookies after they cool.","3.0","Yummy out of the oven, but crumble after cooling","1259539200"

So glad a mainstream company is now offering GF options.Some reviews say this isn't 100% GF, but my daughter eats these with no problem and she is very sensitive.  If her food is prepared with even a contaminated utensil, she will become sick within an hour.  Betty Crocker makes all their GF mixes in a dedicated GF facility.Peanut butter brownies:  First prepare brownies as directed; cool completely.  Then microwave 1/2 cup peanut butter for 20-30 seconds until thinned, spread evenly over the top of the brownies and chill until set.  Finally, microwave 1/2 cup chocolate chips with 1/4 cup milk for 20-30 seconds, stirring until smooth.  Quickly spread over the peanut butter and chill again until set.

A couple of the reviewers described the lentil soup as spicy, but I detected no heat in it at all, and the ingredients don't list any spicy ingredients, so I don't know what they're talking about.  Of course you can add some seasonings to your taste, but if you're used to soups that have more intense flavor right out of the package (most commercial soups are wildly salty, but low sodium doesn't have to mean flavorless) you may be disappointed.","3.0","Healthy But Bland","1383782400"

I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:1.

"naturegirl","B002C4U0MU","this is not a very healthy chip. it leaves a thickly oily, itchy feeling in the throat, which is reminiscent of cruder cooking oils--not olive oil (nevermind the tacky grease fingers). after doing my own research (which everyone who is interested should do on their own, including contacting the manufacturer if they are so inclined), I found that it is being made in the states with canola oil, but with a flavor profile and packaging that would appeal to current taste trends. so these are not chips baked or even fried in olive oil--they are chips kettle fried actually in canola and soybean oil (as if the canola were not bad enough on its own), sunflower oil, and then misted with olive oil for its flavor alone. we need to read labels when we shop, to ensure that we are getting what we actually want. if you are not interested in going for the healthiest option out there or in cutting unnecessary, unhealthy fats, and if you are not drawn to the word ""Olive Oil"" on a bag of chips because of its healthier attributes, but are merely looking for a chip with an olive oil flavor, then this product might appeal to you, despite its slightly higher sodium content. but be mindful. this is not a smartly made product--only smartly marketed.","1.0","not made with olive oil, but flavored with it","1381017600"

It is not so much the flavors as it is the quality of the nuts and dried fruit, which tended to be stale on one side and tough on the other; think grocery store bulk nuts and dried fruit.  In addition the size is on the smaller size for a serving given the cost, but the small size package is a thankful issue given the unappealing quality of the product in my variety pack.

The apples were a little sweeter than I wanted, but it didn't ruin the snack as a whole.  I would definitely eat these again.The Cashews with Pomegranate and Vanilla were a completely different story.  They were much too sweet, and the sugary vanilla coating managed to be both sticky and gritty.  The tapioca flavor (which I wasn't expecting) overwhelms a lot of the other tastes, and I don't care for tapioca.I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars because I thought the Classic Fruit Plus Nut Blend was terrific, but I recommend staying away from the Cashews with Pomegranate and Vanilla.","4.0","classic fruit plus nut is great","1382400000"

"nonpareil","B002DM62BY","These are elegant little packages of deliciously-enhanced almonds with a few cranberries thrown in. You could see them as clever party favors.The nuts seem to have different preparations so you get a variety. Mine are perfectly fresh and have a tasty blend of sweet, tart and salt. Another practical, thoughtful touch I appreciate is the notch off to one side of the top of the package meant for ease of opening. If you use care, you can tear a neat opening the right size for shaking out individual or a few nuts at a time, without destroying the integrity of the package.Personally, I wouldn't use these Sahale Snacks as a road food because I am quickly finding that something about them causes me to go into coughing fits. That wouldn't be good while driving. An educated guess is that I am reacting to the amount and kind of salt and that it is probably an allergic reaction. The good news is that they are declared to be gluten-free.At any rate, nuts are a most healthy food although I might choose them without the added extras. But I definitely would choose these 1.5 ounce packages because those help me control my addictive reaction to having nuts around.

"nonpareil","B002DVNM7W","When considering the greater nutritional value of black rice, along with the great aroma and desired chewiness, this rice seems a good value. Please note it is not sold as organic, if you care about that.I wanted to discover its basic flavor and confess I cooked it in a variable temperature crockpot with a pork roast. In this case, I rinsed the rice prior to adding it to the roast and liquid, and had salted the water lightly. I noticed even while rinsing it, that it possessed a great aroma, which continued to manifest during the cooking process. And: FLAVOR manifested during the eating process!You may want to know that the coloring of black rice is so strong that it can and will stain white porcelain-type cooking vessels. Mine are Corning Cookmates and have been used for almost 40 years now (by my father before me) and have acquired a network of fine scratches, so it makes sense that a strong dye can enter. I will eventually bleach out the stain but couldn't get it with baking soda, which is my usual solution. So for this batch I used a slow-cooker with a black ceramic insert; that solved it.The grains are smaller than I am used to with the Lundberg brand. Thus I had to use a finer-mesh strainer for washing, as too many fell through my regular strainer. No big problem; just thought I'd pass on the info. I also would mention another aspect so you won't be surprised: If a few grains are scattered about, they will look precisely like small mouse turds. This was initially unnerving to me because I've been unable to catch some particularly small rodents (they may be shrews or voles) that are leaving this type of calling card, because they are too light to trip the traps.

"Cher","B002EAPHKM","I bought is a while back, it was $9.58 then (I can get it at two local stores for under $8.00 but because I don't drive I though I would get another tube for my grandkids.  Anyway, when I went back to order I noted that they have jumped to $11.58, over $3 dollars more than if I have my son pick up when in town or if I pick-up when I can get a ride.I order a lot from online,I used to order everything form Amazon, now I look around and buy for other sites because the cost here have jumped-up so much.  When I saw the price jump on this item, I decided to look around online and I found at Walmart I could get them for $7.54 (They offer free shipping if over $45.) So with all of the  things that I needed, I decided to order. (But even if I ordered just this, and if I paid the shipping it was still less than getting the licorice here.)But that isn't all I want to tell you about, as an FYI I wanted to tell you about a purchased that I just made of  26 items.  As I started the order, that there was a issue with the coast, so I made a list, and I compared the prices for the same or similar items between here and there. The difference was shocking, the same or similar items cost $62.03 more here.  So when all was said and done, I bought them elsewhere, rather than from Amazon.I really like Amazon, the way it is set up and its customer service.  (I am not talking about Amazons 3rd party sellers, the 3rd party sellers for the most part are rude and they don't really care what you think or try to fix problems.NOT all of the 3rd party sellers, but about 4 out of 5.)  So sadly, I am now spending time, looking a the cost of things from several sites, rather than just here.  I like ONE STOP SHOP (shop and buy) but I guess those days are gone.Amazon's customer service has always done right be me.

I was eating granola, it didn't taste like cardboard, I can eat healthy has it's not so bad!  Well, I have one of those Weight Watcher cards from a few years back *ahem* and I calculated that 3/4 cup of this is 4 points.  3/4 cup isn't so much, but it's fine since this is granola, for me, it took a lot longer to chew so I was satisfied.  The 2 other reviews says it's healthy...yes, probably healthier than Frosted Flakes or Froot Loops, I suppose.  The box doesn't even claim ""healthy"", just ""organic"".  So be careful if you are looking for ""healthy"" too.A week later, I bought Fiber One Caramel Delight and for 1 cup, it was only 2 points and the flavor was GOOD!  So, if you are looking for good flavored granola only, I'd recommend this.  If you are looking to eat more healthy, try the Fiber One Caramel Delight first, I'm going to review that for 5 stars.FYI - I paid $12.20 (with subscribe and save) for a pack of 5.

They use cold treating instead.  The enzymes in honey, if kept in their pure form, work against bacteria in your stomach.But for cooks, and foodies, you can look at that or not--the fact is this honey is so delicious---it has a creaminess and smoothness you would not expect from your store bought honey.My favorite treat, especially for travel, is to make a peanut butter sandwich and  spread this honey over it.  It is so simple but complex in flavor and absolutely delicious, full of protein, and the health benefits of honey on top of it.

These beans provide consistent deliciousness when just ground, and that's the way it should be!Comes in 5 pound bag, and storage might be a little challenging. Per expert advice, I put the beans into several air-tight bags, removed all the air from each,  put 4 pounds in the freezer and left out 1 pound for immediate use. I grind enough for a day every morning and keep the beans in the pantry.Yes, there is conflicting advice about freezing vs. do not freeze.

Which makes it convenient to buy directly from them and the roasting dates are within a few days of your order.5 lbs. is a lot of coffee for one person. So I bagged 10-12 bulging full plastic baggies and put them in the freezer for use when needed. It would take too long for one person to finish the 5 lb. bag within a few weeks.But the smell was awesome when I packed the baggies. My apt. smelled like a coffee house for days, awesome!The beans are a dark brown color, slight oily sheen, smells great when grinding, best part of the day actually, the taste is good, bold like, or strong depending on how much coffee/water you use, lets you know you are drinking real coffee, I like it.I use the drip method, a single cup Melitta plastic drip cone right over the cup, brown paper filters. Less parts to break, simple clean up.I also tried a 1lb. bag of ""Smoked Coffee"" from Coffee Bean Direct.

"Dragoneer","B002GWH6MA","Like two other Coffee Bean Direct teas that I've ordered, the Earl Grey has a great bargain price for good quality tea. I brew and refrigerate a gallon at a time. The amount of tea that I need to make a gallon seems smallish - I'd estimate a little over a cubic inch. The bag measures to 200 cubic inches so I'm estimating 12 cents a gallon plus or minus some. Now that is a bargain! Since the tea tastes great, it's a real bargain.The unique ingredient in Earl Grey is called ""oil of bergamot"" and that is what gives the tea its unique aroma though it only has a small effect on the taste. The aroma in the bag is really kicky so take a sniff and enjoy.The only minus on this tea is the amount shipped, 2 lbs, and the large volume: where you going to store it? I'm keeping it in the bag but that might let the tea get stale after a while. I'd be willing to pay a dollar or two more if the tea shipped in a resealable bag, probably metal instead of paper, that was designed for long-term storage. This consideration does not knock off a star since it's a bargain even if I had to throw half of it away.","5.0","Great Bargin - Good Tea","1335052800"

"Dragoneer","B002GWH7O2","I ordered two 2 lb bags of tea. The first one looked like a standard 2 lb bag but I couldn't understand why the shipping carton was so big. Then I removed the peppermint bag and all was revealed: By measurement, the 2 lb peppermint bag was 4-5 times the volume of the other 2 lb bag. In other words, you are going to get a lot of tea for your money. I experimented with amount needed to brew a good tasting batch and I found that I should use the same amount (volume) I would of a heavier tea. Therefore, you are getting 4-5 times the amount of brewed tea for the same price. The tea tastes very good, about four and a half stars. I made it five stars because of the super bargain. The taste is very minty with a subtle bitter tea back taste. I don't use sweetener but this is one tea that might improve with a little.","5.0","Super bargain!","1315958400"
"Dragoneer","B002GWH7QA","In case you have never brewed gunpowder or wonder why the name: This tea is very dry and the leaves are small and rolled tight. When the hot water hits the leaves, they ""explode"" - they swell to many times their original size. Thus, the name gunpowder refers more to the dry preparation technique of the leaves and the way they expand than it does to thy type of leaves or their taste. Warning, if you brew this tea (or any other gunpowder) use about 1/2 or 1/4 the amount that you would use with another tea. The tea is pretty bitter, a taste I like but it isn't for everyone.

"Bud","B002H0627G","I have a real sweet tooth, but I have really fallen for unsweetened almond milk.  This product is delicious in a glass or in cereal.  It is filling and really satisfies without the extra sugar found in milk.  I have no desire for the sweetened versions, either.  It does have a slightly nutty flavor, which I like, and which complements cereal especially well -- think Honey Nut Cheerios tasty.  For reference, I am not a fan of soy milk, though.  I am not a diabetic, but I am nonetheless trying to cut down on unnecessary sugars in my diet (so that I don't become one).With that said, I can barely taste the chocolate flavor.  Instead, it is so little, that I think it just adds extra calories/carbs.  While the original/unflavored version of Almond Breeze is only 5 calories and 1g carbs less, I usually buy the Silk original and unsweetened almond milk which is only 35 calories.  I guess what I'm saying is that I can't taste that extra 10 calories (or 29%) of flavor to warrant the price or difficult in finding this product.Be also careful on the price.  The price varies wildly here on Amazon.  For me, I will likely stick with Silk unsweetened almond milk and buy this only as a treat when the price is right.","3.0","Love it, but not very chocolaty","1336521600"

"Renter","B002H0627G","I like the texture and look of 2 percent milk over cereal, but unfortunately for me, my taste buds changed over the years and I no longer like the flavor of milk. Lactic acid now tastes really sour to me, but even lactose-free milk has something lurking in it that my taste buds object to. Almond milk solves my dilemma nicely. The texture is closer to 2 percent milk than any other milk substitute I've come across, and the flavor is mild and slightly nutty. The color is only slightly off, being a pale off-white instead of the stark white of milk. I love being able to eat cold cereal again like I did as a child. The only milk substitute that tastes better for this purpose is oat milk, which makes cereal taste like cereal only more so, but oat milk has a slightly gray cast to it that is kind of off-putting.

Something ""chemical"". Something that stays on the tongue when you'd think it wouldn't.I waited for a nice hot day to have this; had it chilled down in the fridge, waiting. It did give me the fog-clearing of caffeine but when I found it a bit strong, I tried cutting it with my nonfat milk. Whoa - the color didn't even alter, this is STRONG stuff. When I got to half milk, it began to have a lighter look, and the taste became more what I like. I kept sipping it and getting a reaction that it tastes somewhat chemical compared to my usual brew. I wanted to like it but don't completely but that may be just me, and partially the effect of it having the sugar that I am no longer used to.If you prefer your coffee without sweetener as I do, please note the manufacturer does produce an unsweetened version.","4.0","Strong stuff...","1341878400"

Who doesn't love a fast, easy to prepare dinner? This is one of the few options that do not list chilies in the ingredients.I don't know what Channa Masala is supposed to taste like, but this quick-nuke version is very good. This isn't spicy (hot/fiery) at all but that doesn't make it any less flavorful. It has a really nice thick tomato/onion flavored sauce and the chickpeas have a semi-firm/semi-soft texture. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty this was.I have a tiny microwave but this package fit easily and didn't make a mess (I expected one but there was no splatter) and it was easy to handle the hot package after cooking. I've also cooked this in a glass bowl instead of it's packaging, that's actually easier.This and theTasty Bite Peas Paneer Entree, Heat & Eat, 10-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)(which has a little spicy kick), over rice, made a super fast, filling and delicious meal in just minutes.

However, the sizes of each item in this pack are even smaller than those portions (they're tiny, almost like samples), and there are fewer of them, so the result is a meal only for a small child, or a light snack for an adult. At the price, I don't find this a very good value; you might not be able to have a great meal for the cost of this box, but you should be able to do better than this.The items themselves are healthy and inoffensive, if lacking in much flavor.  Some crackers, some dried soybeans, some dried cranberries, a small tube of hummus, and a tiny piece of candy.  OK if you're hiking or driving--if you don't mind opening five different packages and either carrying the wrappers and box around with you or finding a place to dispose of them.  This creates a lot of unnecessary trash in relation to the small amount of food, which I consider a real downside of a product like this--it's very wasteful for the sake of a very little bit of convenience. I'd rather spend a few minutes putting some crackers, dried fruit, etc. in a reusable container than buy this--much less expense as well as wasted packaging.In any event, the miniature sizes make it likely you'll still be hungry. Moreover, although the product is advertised as ""GoEnergy,"" these items don't provide much quick energy.

It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener.

It makes it creamy and just a little spicy like a chai tea. VERY enjoyable and soothing when not feeling well. It's also come in handy for morning sickness recently.","5.0","Good stuff!","1329523200"

"ephemeral","B002PNW4Y0","This chocolate covered strawberries bar was pretty disgusting.  It tasted like neither chocolate nor strawberries, and while there is cocoa listed in the ingredients, there aren't actually any strawberries in it.  I guess that's why it doesn't taste like strawberries.  What it does taste like is cherry cough syrup.  It left a pretty unpleasant taste in my mouth, so I ended up brushing my teeth a few minutes after eating it.This is not a product that I will ever eat again.","1.0","Tastes like cough syrup","1369440000"
"lore","B002PNW4Y0","This is a pretty straight-forward protein bar. There's a thin layer of chocolate over a solid pale center typical of most protein bars - it has the consistency of marzipan (finely ground almond and sugar that makes a gritty paste), but without the same sweetness.What I appreciated about the bar is that it wasn't overly sweet or a candy bar in disguise. I thought the strawberry flavor could have been stronger, though. In that respect, I don't think the bar had an abundance of flavor. It was filling, and I think it would make a good snack or a breakfast or lunch replacement.I think what was most impressive to me was the fact that it didn't have an aftertaste. I've tried a lot of protein bars, and they often either taste terrible, taste fine until a few minutes after finishing and then your mouth tastes terrible, or they're candy bars in a healthy disguise. This bar tasted fine.

"Chandler","B002RBRY0Y","I'm torn on this review because I do think these are good chocolates.  I LOVE chocolate.My issue is that I am kind of a chocolate snob I guess where I really love chocolate that is more pure--to me I can taste the difference.  But that's not to say that Lindt does not make some fine chocolates, it is just that the center, to me, doesn't taste so natural and is more liquid-y than I would prefer.But here is the thing--and why I did not rate it average, I rated it above average--because when I put them in the fridge they taste better to me.I mean, they aren't your super high cacao European chocolate, but they are good, and I enjoy them.  For me, they aren't the kind of thing I know is in the fridge and have to make myself resist though--while the high cacao fine chocolate ones in my drawer are.But it's not a fair contest really when I think about it like that.  These are more affordable and they are more unusual to have that liquid center.  Sure they are more commercial and I may not be a big fan of the liquidy part of them--but that's so personal AND, the thing that brought them up to that greater star, is they taste darn good cold.Plus I love dark chocolate so I still like these better than the original version.In my opinion most would probably love them and I am looking at them in that regard--I have an odd palate for chocolate so I am trying to take a more fair and rounded view on this one, while still adding my own opinion for those like me.","4.0","I like them lots, but I don't crave them...","1398816000"

Within an hour or so of ingesting the first one, the telltale gurgling began in my gut, which means that I am now in for at least 24 hours of misery which includes unscheduled fecal incontinence. Not fun. (Recent, late onset celiac disease.) Should have read ingredients first, I agree. When my body said ""Uh oh, something's wrong"", I did read: ""Dark sweet chocolate,[sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter; skim milk, milkfat, soya lecithin (emulsifier), vanillin (artificial flavoring)], vegetable oil (coconut, palm kernel), sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk, soya lecithin (emulsifier), barley malt, artificial flavors.""

So I am putting up this warning for the many others who for one reason or another avoid ingesting gluten.All is not lost in the sense that I don't really like these that much anyway. (And it happens I can stay near enough the pottie for the next day or so while getting lots of reviews finished!) These seem bland, and lack that dark chocolate bite that I prefer.

These were melted so very badly that the chocolate was seeping through the manila envelope in which they were packed and onto the rest of my mail!  Ugh!However, I salvaged one out of the package that still had some chocolate left in the wrapper and put it in the fridge to harden.  YUM!  Wow, what a treat these things are on a cold, rainy day!  Very smooth, just melt in your mouth chocolate.

As you can see, I love them.  Four stars are given for almost 1/4 of the truffles I received had melted in transit.  Luckily they are individually wrapped so I just put them in the refrigerator and let them cool and then they were fine.  But this should not happen.  For what the Lindt Lindsor truffles cost they should indeed be shipped in a way to avoid any problems such as this.  The fact that they are delicious is a given but if they can't be shipped better I suggest going to your local Lindt Linsor store as I have here in Boston where you can guarantee they are fresh.

It was difficult to eat one without getting my hands dirty, and as a result this isn't something I would keep in my desk at work for a snack or pack in my lunch.

"naturegirl","B002RD5I78","I first bought this cracker at a local store, because it was gluten-free and buckwheat, and I like buckwheat. I did not expect to like it as much as I did (I thought the taste would be similar to that of rice cakes, and was ok with that), but the texture is unique and the cracker is very crispy and light--you could eat a box and not know it. I also enjoyed the mild, wholesome flavor, and have found it to be a great match equally with sweet or savory toppings, such as: Whole Foods' self-serve honey peanut butter; Trader Joe's cookie butter; Key Ingredients Hot Horseradish and Ale cheese dip (which I get at WF); a very nice quality, Spanish tuna (like Ortiz Bonito or Cuca Ventresca); or some creamy goat cheese (which I get from TJ's) topped with some capers and a nice smoked salmon.. : )  When I found these crackers on Amazon, I immediately bought the multipack. After discovering my favorite way to snack on it--with some thin slices of Trader Joe's goat brie and a thin drizzle of raw, organic honey on top--I came back and ordered 4 more. I had originally also purchased a multipack of the Quinoa flavor, but the Buckwheat is my favorite of the two. In comparison, I thought the quinoa lacked flavor and was just the tiniest bit saltier (but keep in mind that both are almost completely sodium-free). I will also share that we had a visiting relative who went through 6 boxes of both of these crackers, without being on any kind of gluten-free diet, so this is a great cracker that anyone can enjoy. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys simple, natural, healthy-tasting foods with few ingredients (and low sodium), or who is looking for the perfect cracker that goes with everything and frames it with a great texture without clashing or eclipsing it in any way.

"barry","B002TMV34E","I must admit that I had never tried any style of Melitta coffee before this Cafe Collection Classique Supreme.  I am an avid coffee drinker and have at leat 6 cups every morning.  It is just part of my regular routine.  I crave the cafeine and the taste just wakes me up and starts any day perfectly.  I always get a medium blend and find that with generic coffee be it Folgers, Maxwell House or any store brand I don't really notice a taste difference.So it was a treat to try a coffee that is considered  a delicacy and not just a power boost.  This coffee is a pleasure from just opening the bag.  The aroma of just the beans is beautiful.  And when you go to make the coffee you will probably do the same as me and go to measure the amount equal to the water amount the same as when you make your standard coffee.  But you may have to toy with the measurement of coffee per ounces of water to be able to fully appreciate this coffee.  It was nice to have this coffee that is part of a specialty collection meet up to my expectations.  The beans are ground extra fine and though still providing a medium blend quality it far surpasses my regular coffee.  It definitely is smoother and the taste is rich and full providing a very satisfying coffee experience.  I found myself slowing down and enjoying each sip with absolute pleasure.As I said I am not one to explore all the supposedly specialty roasts or flavored coffees but am very glad I came across this Melitta blend.

"Bud","B002TMV3CG","First, our family drinks an almost absurd amount of coffee.  I pull 10 to 20 espresso shots on a typical day, mostly lattes and frappucino drinks.  Occasionally, we make drip.  For reference, I won't even drink ""office"" grade coffee or typical garbage like Folgers.  I would rather drink a glass of water or a good tea.  So, I am rather familiar with good coffee and probably more demanding than most reviewers here.As a result, I would rate Melitta Blanc et Noir just OK.  It's average.  It is more bitter and acidic than I would like.  It is maybe comparable to Starbuck's coffee which isn't that great.  It is definitely better than many store/house brands.  However, there are some good to great coffees out there including Millstone, Cost Plus' varieties, Peet's, and Illy, the latter, especially being frighteningly expensive.  I do, however, encourage you to try Illy as it has a fantastic, reusable tin.With all that, I give it a bump to 4 stars.  That is because, here at Amazon, especially with their subscription program, it is cheap.  You would probably not notice the difference in frou-frou'ed up drinks with a lot of cream and sugar.  Also, it deserves 4 stars because it is somewhat interesting.  Blanc et Noir is a blend of dark French roast and a light roast.  I expected it to be some middling blend in between, but actually you do get a sense of both the mild roast and the more full, smoky darker roast.  It is interesting, but I'm not sure I'd like it over and over.  I prefer more single bean roasts like a good Columbian Supremo or a well-blended house.Finally, it is listed as ""Extra Fine Grind"".  It is very, very evenly ground which is impressive, but it is not that extra fine.  I would say more of just fine.  It is definitely way too coarse to use in an espresso machine, even with a pressurized portafilter.This product is worth a try, and also be sure to pick up a can of Illy (even for the tin) and try some good Columbian Supremo if you haven't already.  These are good reference coffees, and I made a bunch of A/B tests among them and a couple others before writing this review.","4.0","OK coffee, somewhat interesting","1277337600"

"jt","B002TMV3GC","I am a fairly big coffee drinker that brews my own pot of coffee pretty much every morning and then after lunch will buy a cup at a either SB, Pete's, or if I am lucky enough to be around a Blue Bottle seller.  I admit that in a pinch, I will drink some of the sludge we have in the office (caffeine addiction is sad thing).  I pretty much always brew/order the ""bolder"" coffees.  My favorite being Sumatra.  No milk, creamer, sugar, or anything else that would get in the way of the flavor of coffee.  That is how I have been drinking this hazelnut flavored coffee the past week.  The first thing you notice even before you brew the first cup is that the hazelnut is not real hazelnut.  The front of the package very clearly (which is kind of odd but, commendable in terms of full disclosure) states the flavoring is artificial.  Really, fake nuts?  Come on.  Well, after brewing several pots I have to say that this stuff is just not very good, artificial flavored or not.  There is a hazelnut taste and smell but, it really does smell and taste oddly off.  The taste is somewhat cardboard like with a sort of metallic finish.  I know it isn't my coffee making equipment since I am using the same stuff I normally brew.  It's not bitter and has pretty low acidity.  I tried mixing the grounds with half of my usual coffee and it pretty much just tainted my regular coffee.  I have had hazelnut flavored coffees from other producers and although I was not a fan of the flavoring they didn't have these off tastes.  Maybe the flavored coffees just aren't for me.  I equate this stuff to office brew.  It'll work in a pinch but not something I would buy.","2.0","Office Grade Coffee","1277078400"

I think you'd call this a ""balanced"" blend... it is not very acidic or bitter with a medium color and is both fairly mellow and smooth in flavor.Good for a middle-of-the-road cup of coffee to be enjoyed any time of the day.

I admit I tried these packages because two of them came with my Whirley Pop popper, but now they are the only brand I buy.  These are the 5.5 ounce size and they fill up the Whirley Pop right to the top.  They make smaller packages, but they do not fill up the popper, this is the perfect size.  It is also delicious, not too salty and perfectly buttery.  The popcorn also maintains it's crunch hours after popped (we regularly pop it and put it in a bag and take it on the road with us!) We tried some other brands of similar packaging and found them to be way too salty.You could certainly make cheaper popcorn by purchasing larger packages of the individual ingredients and measuring them out yourself, but why?  Each of these packages contains popping corn, yellow buttery salt, and coconut oil all pre-measured so you just have to cut off the top and dump it in.

"csm","B002YJ6K2M","I remember my dad giving a British friend of his a cup of tea made with Lipton 30 years ago.  To say in the least, dad's friend was a bit offended, and said, ""Disgusting way to make tea!""  Back then, however, Lipton was the only brand to buy here in the U.S. worth having.  I've been served Lipton for 40+ years and have always enjoyed it, never having ""real"" tea until I traveled to England a few years ago.  Awesome stuff too, there really is no comparison I might add, and I now fully understand my dad's friend's complaint!Now to the question, I'm wondering if anyone else out there has noticed a significant difference in Lipton over the past 2 years.  It just does not seem to be as strong to me as it once was, and takes an unusually long time to brew compared to years past.  Its normal robust flavor has weakened, or so it seems, and it somewhat resembles a knock-off brand of tea instead of the Lipton we've come to expect.  When making iced tea, we now have to use 8 bags per gallon instead of the usual 6.  Honestly, I've started going to specialty tea shops in town to get Yorkshire tea, something I KNOW is served in England.  I've become that disappointed in Lipton over the years but in a pinch, it's still the only one I buy.  I can recommend it for children, if you will, but if you're expecting the Lipton we've always known, I'm afraid that you might have to start using 2 teabags per cup.","4.0","Difference, anyone?","1298505600"

It's aromatic, dark but does not taste or smell burnt. Very nice. It is also good for those living alone or who do not drink coffee very often - this one is packed in relatively smaller packages, not into 2.2 lb bigger bags some other beans come in.","5.0","very good and not expensive","1313625600"

"sjw","B002ZOKOE6","Maybe I got a bad batch, if that's possible, but I completely disagree with the other reviews. I normally drinkYuban Traditional Decaf Ground Coffee, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6), but lately the supply (and price!) at Amazon has been really poor, so I thought I'd try this Luzianne Decaf.I like dark, rich coffee, and finding that flavor--without bitterness, in a decaf, is difficult. After reading the product description & the reviews here, I was expecting a decaf with bold flavor & no bitterness. I was disappointed. This coffee IS bitter, and it is NOT a ""bold, rich taste,"" as the description claims.I know everyone has different tastes, but if you're used to Yuban decaf & you're looking for another brand with a similar flavor, this Luzianne Decaf is not what you want.","2.0","Bitter, poor flavor","1381363200"

I love to cook and plan on having my kids eat what I make for them each night instead of cooking them their own 'dinners'.  Having unique flavor combo's like Banana, Peach and Mango, helps my baby to develop his taste buds.  You don't see Mango everyday in baby foods.  I use it all the time in smoothies and as snacks for my toddler.  Sometimes I don't have the time to cut up fruit, sit him in the highchair and then clean up the inevitable mess that follows.  Giving him one of these pouches, I know he is getting all the goodness of organic fruits and veggies.  We kept them in our freezer this summer and used them as a treat in the afternoons.  Just let it defrost for about 10-15 minutes and it becomes easier to get out of the pouch, but is still icy and cold.","5.0","Love The Flavor Combo","1345939200"

"ghost","B0031JK95S","It Works for me perfectly. It taste good & sort of like a vanilla/banana shake. First let me to all the people that keep saying that it mixes up to thick, well I found out why, it is because the scoop is actually really a double scoop because if you look insides of the scoop it has a fill to line inside of the scoop, so you are only suppose to fill only tip the line in the middle of the scoop & yes I agree with what your probably thinking because I thought the same thing & that is, why did they give a big scoop that is double what you should mix & the answer is I do not know, but I think they are trying to get you to make that mistake & use it up sooner then what it would last if you were mixing it up correctly or something. Who really know whats these companies do stuff for, but I thought at the time of grabbing this scoop that why didn't they just give us the right size scoop in the big bottle/canister? Don't really know, but all I know the first time I mixed this up I filled the scoop only tip the middle fill line that you can only see inside the scoop, so when I mixed the powder up it tuned out perfectly & I even mixed it with a banana & almond milk & spring water with no sugar because for me it does not need any because it is actually sweet enough.  It is a really good probiotic & fiber supplement, not to mention all of the organic healthy plant based nutrition in it. It feels the stomach using the Psyllium Husk & Chia seeds & flax seeds in it & it just works perfectly for me. The pros part I am copy & pasting from this companies websitePros:(My Words): It taste similar to a vanilla/banana shake & it includes all of the healthy nutrition that your body needs especially vitamins, so you don't have to take a multivitamin because it has everything in it already. Love itPros: (Now ""Garden of Life's"" Words):RAW Meal goes beyond organic by providing live probiotics and enzymes, Vitamin Code RAW Food-Created vitamins and minerals, as well as nutrient Code Factors such as beta-glucans, SOD, glutathione and CoQ10, enabling natural recognition by your body.Containing 26 superfoods from RAW organic seeds, sprouts and greens, RAW Meal provides 34 grams of protein, 9-16 grams of fiber (depending on flavor) and a healthy 2.5 grams of fat making it an excellent choice for ""weight conscious"" individuals. RAW Meal also offers 20 Vitamin Code vitamins and minerals providing at least 100% of the Daily Value of 16 key nutrients.Just as important is what's NOT included in RAW Meal. It is gluten-free, dairy-free and lactose-free. It has no fillers, no synthetic nutrients, no artificial flavors or sweeteners and no preservatives.What are the Key Benefits of RAW Meal?A convenient meal-on-the-go, RAW Meal is suitable for almost anyone including those on vegetarian or vegan diets, those on low carbohydrate diets or those with gastrointestinal sensitivities to milk, whey or other protein sources. RAW Meal offers the following:* Provides the nutrition of a well-balanced, healthy meal* Naturally filling, satisfies hunger, provides energy* Excellent source of RAW organic, plant-based protein (34g) - including all essential amino acids* Excellent source of 20 Vitamin Code vitamins and minerals - RAW Food-Created Nutrients and RAW Food-Chelated Minerals that enable targeted delivery and natural recognition by your body* Excellent source of soluble and insoluble fiber (9-16g) depending on flavor* Provides live probiotics and enzymes for healthy digestion* Made exclusively from RAW natural, plant-based, whole foods - uncooked, untreated, unadulterated* Contains 13 RAW organic sprouts, 4 RAW organic cereal grass juices, 5 RAW organic fruits, spirulina and chlorella* No Trans FatsRAW Meal naturally satisfies hunger and increases energy, making it great for those looking to manage their diet and looking for a convenient alternative to the pre-packaged or fast-food meals that dominate our on-the-go lifestyles.CONS: The huge double the size scoop which is very confusing for the purchaser & user of this product.I'm not taking any stars off from the five stars because I think it is a very good product & plus I was one of the ones that was not tricked by the size of the scoop because I looked at other peoples reviews first because when I pulled it out I knew/noticed this scoop looked just way to big especially for the amount of water, almond milk or liquid of your choice, so I immediately started looking for a fill line & plus I knew what to look for because I order & use a lot of plant based herbs, so a lot of them have fill line scoops, but usually the right size unlike this one. But all in all it's an excellent product & I surely recommend this product & I will most definitely be purchasing this product again & probably for a life time because it has everything in it that I was paying way more for by purchasing many of the plant based herb in this product by themselves, so this with everything was way cheaper for me because just my probiotic was 31 dollars by it self, so when I came across ""Garden of Life Raw Meal"" I was just totally stoked. Plus I like the fact that it is Organic Raw & Plant Based because I changed my diet to a mostly raw organic veggies & fruits by juicing them, making smoothies & eating fruits & veggies, making salads, No processed food's of any kind. I eat steamed veggies & soups, but only vegetable soups made by my own hands for health reasons & this program works out good for me personally.

"Autumn","B0031TJ0X0","I'm a bit of a noob to serious tea drinking. I've always liked tea, but only recently have I become completely obsessed. Within the last 6 months I've begun to accumulate all kinds of tea. Within that time period this tea has quickly made its way into my favorites and I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out.I love this stuff. No, I mean I LOVE it. Seriously. While it isn't actually tea at all, it's prepared the same way - add the 'leaves', steep, add preferred additives, drink, YUM. There is no actual tea in this product, it's all cocoa bean shells. Because of this, you have to like the natural, earthy cocoa flavor (like that of dark, dark, dark organic chocolate you might find in a health food store) to like this tea. If you're expecting it to taste like a candy bar or cake you'll be disappointed. While it DOES smell like candy, it simply does not taste that way. (However, I suppose you could add an absurd amount of sweetener to give it a candy taste but that really counteracts a lot of the health benefits of this tea. It also takes away from it's natural taste which is amazing!)The thing that caught my eye about this tea initially was the flavor, of course. What made me really decide to make the purchase was all of the claims. The description says it has vitamin D and iron - which is especially good for someone like me who is both anemic and vitamin D deficient who could use as much of that in their daily intake as they can get- and it also claims to have natural serotonin raising capabilities due to the fact it's pure cocoa, which as most people know, is good for you and full of feel-good elements.While I can't prove or disprove any of those things, I will say this tea is delicious and worth the somewhat hefty price. You get a lot of bang for you buck and unless it's your staple tea you drink every day, several times a day it should last you quite a while.I'd like to note that the tea-to-water ratio recommended on the container might be a little exaggerated. I use a little over half the recommended tea to go with the amount of water I'm using, and it does just fine. It doesn't taste watery or weak at all. And unlike most teas, you can let this steep while you're drinking it and there's no gross, over steeped taste. I've also found you can also re-steep the tea 2-3 times before any substantial loss in flavor. Knowing that that, it can more than double the cups of tea you get per tin.Anyway, the main point is I really like this tea and recommend it.","4.0","Tasty, earthy cocoa flavor","1338163200"

It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.So in short, amazing high quality ghee, but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high qualityPurity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ouncebrand ghee.","5.0","Tastes amazing, but a bit expensive","1321488000"

"ephemeral","B00338DPF8","I would not recommend this pasta.  The taste was ok, if a little bland.  However, the texture was very unpleasant.  The pasta itself got soft very fast, but the cheese filling inside remained in an unpleasant powder form.  I tried cooking it a little longer, thinking that the cheese might melt or start to dissolve or something, but it never happened.  I ended up eating slightly overcooked noodles, each of which was filled with a little ball of powdered cheese.  The cheese was gritty and tasted too strong.I like the idea of a cheese-stuffed pasta that you can store in the cupboard, but if this is the end result, I'm not interested.","2.0","Gritty, Powdered Cheese","1359158400"

I'm not sure I could actually taste it, but the pasta did seem to have a somewhat richer flavor than I'm accustomed to.

"barry","B00338DSQ4","I love pasta and the spaghetti noodle is my favorite.  Sometimes I have the traditional spaghetti and meatballs.  Other cooking options for me are just spaghetti and sauce, spaghetti and sauce mixed with cut up chicken breast or as a side dish.  I've never been one to purchase fresh pasta.  You usually need to use it right away and I like having some always on hand for when I want it.  Many think that when it comes to boxed pasta there can't be much of a difference in the quality of various brands.  I used to use the store brand and then experimented with other name brands before trying Barilla.  Barilla, with all their pastas, manages to provide a product that always cooks with a fresh quality as long as you cook it correctly.  There is nothing worse than limp noodles.  The only way that will happen with Barilla is if you indeed overcook it.  Otherwise it is quite easy to get a perfect al dente spaghetti and cooking a little longer may be more to your liking and it will still remain fresh tasting.  Barilla also tastes very good when the spaghetti is reheated in the microwave which is very rare with a boxed pasta.  For me it is the sign of a good product.  I tend to cook 8 ounces at a time and the good thing about pasta is you can open the box and it still remains fresh.  So with each 32 ounce box I get 4 meals.  With Barilla spaghetti always on hand I know whenever the craving hits quality is at my hands.  Recommend Barilla very much as one of the best boxed pastas out there.","5.0","Great boxed pasta","1361318400"
"eyecore","B00338DSQ4","There's not a ton you can say about spaghetti.  Barilla, the creator of this stuff, didn't mess it up - it's exactly like any other spaghetti you've ever purchased, cooked, and/or eaten that's made with semolina and durum flour.  (Rice spaghetti, along with wheat spaghetti and whatever else people want to make it out of has a considerably different texture.)If it's cheaper or more convenient to get this Barilla spaghetti in a 6-pack, than another brand anywhere else, you won't be disappointed.  Or surprised.  It's just spaghetti.","4.0","Interesting...tastes like any other spaghetti I've ever had","1365897600"

In other healthy snack bars I've tried, too often the almonds are a rarity and the fruit tasteless and hard to detect. Not here. Almonds are right up front and fresh, and the dried apricot just the right moistness and very tasty.The bar is soft and chewy rather than crumbly, which is important to me when they are road food and I don't want sticky crumbs all over my vehicle. The eating of these is very manageable.And gluten free! Thank you. Food manufacturers who realize the importance of gluten free are seeing sales improve. If one member of a family must be gluten free, generally the whole family eats that way rather than taunt the one unfortunate. This wisdom is lost on some dinosaurs but not here.The one thing that I'm not thrilled with is the inclusion of little coconut bits. While I like the taste of coconut and feel that it is nutritious, the small bits get stuck in my teeth and are a definite problem when I am playing a reed instrument so I have to find something else to sustain me during rehearsal, etc. The other thing about those coconut bits is somewhat of a danger of aspiration - they aren't very controllable.

"Ghenghis","B0035GXXDM","I usually make my own but I was literally dying for kimchi the other night, and the localgrocery didn't have any so I was fortunate to find this at a nearby Asian market.Classic flavor, the infamous smell everybody complains about is not really bad, its pickledcabbage fer crying out loud. If you dont complain about the smell of dill pickles I promiseyou wont mind this stuff.Got a mild spicy flavor, you can definitely taste the Korean red chili here, but its not overwhelming,its just there for the flavor and blends perfectly with the ginger, onion, and fish sauce, whichis another misunderstood product....basically fish sauce is fermented anchovy, and anchoviesmake everything taste better. If you've ever had a tableside Caesar salad you've already hadand enjoyed anchovies.Just unzip this bag, put it in a plastic container or serve immediately. Needs absolutely nothingbut I do put just a little sugar in the store-bought stuff to tone down the bite. Brown sugar worksas well. Once you get hooked you will find no end of uses for this wonderful product, and youwill be motivated to make your own. If you live in the South and know about Chow Chow, look atthis as Korean chow chow, if you live elsewhere look at this as a modified sauerkraut. And Napacabbage is not a necessity, green cabbage works just as well if not better for homemade.Mix with hamburger meat before grilling (this is unbelievable), or just top your burger or hot dogsor smoked sausage with this. Its also great as a side or on beans and especially in vegetable soups.A home run product from Mama Eun's!Oh yeah, other very good kimchi's that you will find in the store are Sunja's and King's, I find theminterchangeable and both very good.","5.0","This is excellent.","1400198400"

The sauce is nicely spiced, but not overdone and thick and rich without being too heavy.  What please me the most about Ragu is that it is low in fat with only 2 grams per serving and is not high in sugar as many sauces are.  Also its advertised 2 servings of veggies in every 1/2 cup of sauce is indeed true and also provides 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein.  This tells you the product is indeed made of natural products.  For a bottled sauce this is very tasty and hearty and can be used on its own if in a rush.  It's also a great sauce to add additional spices or veggies and meat to if your recipe calls for it.  And if you always do a fresh sauce, slip this Ragu one night to your family and see if they can tell the difference.

"Chandler","B00374ZKQ0","First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAWHaving formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it. Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?Huh-uh.You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.Superb huh?Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.Not so fast.I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter. I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.So that got me thinking...I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.It is 1.75 ounces.I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.But, wait...one more thing...Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too. Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...It wouldn't surprise me.Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't.Comment","1.0","You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.","1320192000"

I don't use it in an air popper, so I'm not sure how it pops in that style of machine.In my machine, the popcorn (all brands) pops in 2 batches, especially when I'm making a lot.

I went ahead and bought two grinders. First time I use it I notice that it gives the food a good flavor even just a few turns of my grinder. ""I like this salt"", I told my husband and I went and search amazon for a better deal. I found a lot as you all know so, I went to stock up buying 5 pounds of coarse pink himalayan salt, as I scrolled down the page, I saw another one that interest me called coarse dark pink salt. The color look so deep..more intense So, out of curiosity I decided and purchased that one as well.  Shipping is very fast and my salt is quite heavy. The priority box is busted when I recieved it. When I open it I was very surprised to see the big difference in color on both salt. I suggest that you check my photos which I posted to help you guys make your purchase. I recieved 2 free wooden small spoons with my purchased which is nice but the other one had a small chip on the tip part. I think it is a bit misleading because you are not getting what you buy. It says pink. The color is not even pink better if they said very light pink almost closer to white or yet himalayan very light pink with specks of pink. I don't know. I though I was buying the same color as the one I bought at costco. Anyway, the dark pink one is closer to the one I purchased at costco. Although, the costco one is look more polish.

It is estimated that over 98% of all corn comes from genetically altered plants and this irritates us a lot.It is up to you to believe whether GMO products are really nasty or not but in case you want to avoid them, your only option for corn is to buy it certified organic.

Take this formula:  most young and first-time mom's thinks that the more stuff is in formula, the more vitamins and minerals it has, and thus, the healthier the kid is going to be.  Trouble is, there is no data to support any of that - we just know that this formula won't kill a person off so quickly as to place blame directly on it.  At any rate, my point is...this powder is stuffed with so many chemical ingredients (basically, &#34;vitamins&#34; that have the synthesized in labs and take out of their normal habitat - foods - in an effort to create a healthy drink.)And with that said - my kid would much rather have some mushed gruel (but with actual food) than this stuff.  It would also much rather have breast milk from real life boobs, rather than this stuff.  But in a pinch, if neither are available, this stuff will keep a kid alive.I can't exactly recommend this.  I would recommend food - mush the stuff up until it's basically liquid if you have to, and you'll be doing your kid a great service.  Need some DHA?  Have some fish.  Don't like fish?  Well...your kid might - everything is a new experience to them.  All in all - keep a small canister of this at the ready in case the boobs aren't available and your homemade baby mush isn't ready, but otherwise...believe nature, not marketing and the belief that you're doing &#34;the best for your baby&#34; that so many mom's are convinced of these days.","2.0","Works as a last resort...","1388102400"

In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well.

"RJ","B003D4F18G","This is my favorite flavor of tea.  I enjoy white tea more than the darker teas, and the mix of peppermint and ginger is perfect.  If you enjoy any kind of peppermint tea or coffee (such as those served around Christmas) you will enjoy this tea.The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the little white packet shown in the picture) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets.  If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).The only negative I've seen is that a few of the tea bags have ""failed.""  By ""failed,"" I mean that when I combine them with hot water they sometimes expand quickly and purge a small amount of tea leaves through the stapled end of the bag.  It's a minor distraction (only once or twice have I had to through it out), but it's probably a 4% failure rate based on my usage so far.  No doubt part of the problem stems from poor technique on my part, but I haven't had this problem with other teas.","5.0","Wonderful flavor!","1302134400"

For those with food allergies though, this box states ""made in a peanut-free and tree nut-free facility"" and is not labeled as containing any of the 8 major allergens.  We love that they are all natural and made without GMOs and that they are shaped like cute little bunnies.  These cookies are made from rice and corn flour instead of wheat.  The only downside is that they are a bit expensive, however we have only found them so far in Whole Foods here in Hawaii and they approach $5 a box.

"ephemeral","B003FOA0WG","With ten different foods, this picnic package contains both hits and misses.  I'm rating each item individually below.Aged Cheddar Cheese Straws, 5/5:  This was by far the best item in the box, and luckily it was also one of the biggest.  They are much more cheese than cracker, with cheddar cheese as the primary ingredient.  There is a bit of an edge to them, just like one would expect with decent aged cheddar.  The addition of pepper and paprika amplifies the bite and makes them perfect.  I loved them!Pretzel Crisps, 3/5:  These very flat pretzel crisps are perfect for dipping or holding pieces of cheese or other goodies.  Unfortunately, mine tasted very stale and weren't quite as crisp as I'd like in a pretzel.Cashew Crunch, 4/5:  I enjoyed these little cashew clusters, which were mixed up with a little sugar, salt, and sesame seeds.  They were maybe just a little plain for my tastes, but I always like a snack with some protein and iron in it.Sausage Bits, 2/5:  These miniature bits of beef sausage tasted great, but they didn't sit well with me.  I ended up with quite and upset stomach after eating just a few of them.Boxed Meal, 3/5:  The ready to eat meal contained a turkey stick, piece of chocolate, apricots pieces, barbecue potato chips, and a mix of almonds, cranberries and peanuts.  The turkey stick and barbecue potato chips weren't that great, but the chocolate, fruit, and nuts were all just fine.Chocolate Chip Cookies, 2/5:  How could they make chocolate chip cookies taste bad?  Apparently adding barley does the trick.  I enjoy barley in soups and casseroles, but it really doesn't belong in cookies.  I'll be sticking to the traditional wheat flour in my cookies in the future, since these cookies were the most disappointing item in the whole picnic package.","3.0","some good, some bad","1305504000"
"reg","B003FOA0WG","Care packages are fun to receive whether you are at camp, school, or in the military.  The GOPICNIC Care Package is easy to send.  It comes in a nice box that just fits everything.  I checked the expiration dates on each of the items in the box I received.  Mine arrived on April 25, 2011.  The earliest expiration date was June 29, 2011, which was the GOPICNIC ready to eat meal.  Other items had July, August and October for the expiration dates.  I would assume, the items in the box will be consumed soon after receiving, so these dates won't be a problem.  If you are getting this to have some emergency supplies on hand, that don't require refrigeration, the dates might be a bit soon.  It is nice that the items inside do not need to be refrigerated until the individual package is opened.If the person you are sending this to prefers healthy snacks, they might be a bit disappointed in the choices.  There are baked pretzel crisps, but they were pretty broken in my package - lots of crumbs.  The cashew crunch looks okay, although evaporated cane juice is listed as an ingredient.  The cheddar cheese straws get 100 of the 150 calories per serving from fat.  There are 2 140 calorie packages of mini chocolate chip cookies which says nut free and whole grain on the front of the package.  The ready to eat meal says it is gluten free with no artificial colors or flavors.  It contains a turkey snack stick, barbecue potato chips , dried apricots, a fruit and nut mix, and a square of dark chocolate.  The final item is a package of Old Wisconsin beef sausage snack bites.  Think Slim Jims in small pieces.  They are 120 calories per serving with 90 from fat.  Consider the person who will be consuming this when you are thinking about sending it to someone.

"lore","B003GTR8IO","Normally, we love Starbucks' coffee, and so we were inclined to like this version of it. However, both me and my Significant Other found the vanilla flavor too strong. For some reason, this is not a pleasant vanilla flavor; I want to say that the aftertaste is a bit on the medicinal side. I wouldn't say the unpleasantness had anything to do with the vanilla flavor being sweet - it wasn't, although to me, not being sweet was a good idea. An added flavor, especially in a coffee labeled ""natural fusions"", ~should~ be just a taste and not mixed up with sugars or syrup.Unfortunately, this flavor didn't work for two people.

Instead of tasting like any flavored candy might, I found the Crystal Light chewy candies to be overwhelming. The orange was the most pleasing to me (too bad there were only 3 in the pack). Lemon and raspberry were downright disgusting, and the strawberry (which is my favorite flavor for everything candy) reminded me more of plastic than strawberry.After trying all four flavors, I have a weird aftertaste and my tongue/the roof of my mouth are slightly agitated. You know that feeling when you eat too many skittles and you've overwhelmed your taste buds?If the taste didn't bother me, the chewy-factor definitely ruined these candies for me. I wanted to bite into one of these and CHEW it, but instead, I bit into it, and the things molded around my teeth. Not exactly fun having to pick it out from between your teeth all the time.The wrappers are like a cool foil, but the foil ends up sticking to the candy itself, thus making it difficult to open without ripping.

"bookreader","B003IN4ORQ","This is by far one of the best coffee blends, I have tried. The beans chosen are a perfect meld, with what seems to be a lower acidity, a by product of the medium roast I presume. Douwe Egberts did their job right in selecting beans for their taste. A typical pattern in many coffee house brands is to throw together a low grade more plentiful bean with a few mid to high range beans and then pawn it off as a quality brew at a higher price. This often results in a coffee blend without taste. Douwe Egberts however, did their taste test on this blend and came out with a true winner.The beans are roasted much lighter than your typical Euro roasts  think  french roast, again this also helps in creating a coffee that is less acidic. Yet while lightly roasted the beans have been roasted enough so that the oils will be released when put through a drip maker or coffee press, a problem usually encountered with  some of the lighter roasts. Their is a defint natural sweetness in the blend that I feel is  enhanced with the use of fat free milk, the lactose sugar of the milk becoming the only additional sweetener need. A full fat milk or cream would mask the complexity of the sutler flavors here and leave you with coffee that is creamer on the taste, but be on par with any store brand stale canned bean type where you taste the cream rather than the coffee.This coffee's blend and flavor would make it great choice for finishing a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs or with a lighter meal where the flavor of the foods are enhanced by a milder coffee that would leaves the food as a co-star with this blend rather than an attention grabbing bitter coffee. Happily five stars and recommended.","5.0","European coffee at its best","1277856000"

I would have liked that part to be on the individual packets so when I am preparing one at work or elsewhere, and I forget - I can check.When I poured it into the water, it started bubbling like alka-seltzer. This drink is effervescent, but does not retain the bubbling effect while you drink it. It mixes fairly well with cold water.Sadly, I was not a fan of the flavor. It gave me the feeling in my stomach that I get when I drink a diet soda. Not sure what it is or if others feel it too, but it is as if I can feel the liquid in my stomach. And the flavor was not very strong. The best way I can describe it is by comparing the flavor to a green tea, where the flavor tastes like it was lightly added and kind of dry. The flavor might be favorable to some, but I was not a fan.I did, however, feel more energy than normal for the remainder of my work shift. I generally feel tired about 75% of the way through my shift, and after having this in the beginning of my work shift, I did not get the tired feeling.So, in conclusion: This EBOOST drink did not meet my taste requirements, but it did indeed provide me with energy so I guess it was a small price to pay for the benefits. I would have rather enjoyed a better tasting drink though.","4.0","Not a fan of the flavor, but gave me energy!","1290038400"

"ephemeral","B003JA5KDU","Orange-flavored EBOOST is a fairly standard energy/vitamin drink.

The B12 amount in particular is very high, and I'm not sure how if that is really necessary.It is supposed to be orange-flavored, but it also contains green tea extract, and I didn't think the orange taste was very authentic.  In fact, I found this drink to be overpowering and unpleasantly bitter.  The first time I tried it, I followed the directions and added 1 package to about 8 oz of water.  However, I found this unpalatable and had to dilute it until I had used 4 times as much water as instructed.  Because the vitamin levels are so high, I don't really have a problem diluting it to such a large extent, but other people might prefer something that is drinkable after following the directions.","3.0","good source of vitamins, but could taste better","1291593600"

Mostly Vegan & Organic. I have lost 60 pounds as a result of making better food choices & staying away from all processed foods. I eat a plant based diet & use as much vegan & organic foods as possible. That helps to also cut out the chemicals that are found in so many foods these days. People don't realize that what we put into our bodies impacts us in so many ways that are so bad for us. I also now have my son eating this way & it has helped to keep him much trimmer since he is naturally a large boy for his age it has made all the difference in the world.

"Chandler","B003THML30","I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.","5.0","Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me","1306195200"

"steveo","B003TN6ZN6","GMO's ARE POISON! pure and simple. Monsanto has been found to falsify and not report bad findings since time immemorial. It is cheaper to pay the fine than it is to not sell the poison, AKA tobacco science. They claim everyone else's research is flawed and they cannot even perform a long term feeding trial...wonder why? When everyone else goes beyond the Monsanto 90 days, they see huge health issues. After years in the market, Monsanto Roundup ready soy geneticists found ~600 extra genes that were not from the soy or the roundup gene, this means there was scrambled genes left behind. A single inserted gene can change the entire genome, measurements show around 20% of the genome changed by a single insertion. Genetic modified bacteria producing L-Tryptophan killed dozens and injured hundreds. RUN from products like this that are poisonous to your children. There is a reason our health in the USA has degraded since GMO's were unleashed! As if the GMO is not bad enough, the crop is sprayed with Roundup dangerous chemical poison, a dynamic double poison brought to you by Monsanto. Canada's FDA said that the BST trials from Monsanto provided to the FDA for acceptance were enough to have it refused and that the FDA regulators who approved it were INCOMPETENT! So much for the BS safety trials of Monsanto. The Monsanto people running trials on BST milk refused to drink their product! We can go on and on Bottom line, do not feed this poison to your infants, keep away from GMO corn, soy, cotton oil, canola. If they have any of these products in them and they are not organic, run! Do your own research, see ""world according to monsanto"", ""genetic roulette"", read ""seeds of deception"", see how Monsanto misleads and lies.

"barry","B003TRFSG2","I'm a huge mayonnaise fan and it makes any sandwich or pasta/potato salad amazing for me.  But I try to eat a healthy diet and regular mayonnaise is not good for you while also being high in fat and calories.  I use lower fat mayonnaise dressings and whether low fat or regular have always found Hellmann's to be the better tasting mayonnaise out there.  Then it was discovered that low fat dressings be it mayonnaise or salad dressings often contain products that still make them unhealthy and also may be high in sugar.  But if made with certain types of oil like olive oil the product is much healthier, contains less fat and the healthy form of oil helps the dressing blend in better with whatever you are making be it a salad, pasta, etc.  Not as much is needed and it is better for you.  This Hellmann's mayonnaise dressing with olive oil has more fat than the low fat option but much less than the regular mayonnaise and the fat there is is not as bad for you.  I find the taste to be great and for me its just as good as any regular mayonnaise.  I don't find any oily taste or strange flavor from the amount of olive oil.I think this is an excellent product but people who love mayonnaise always have their prefered brand and preferred type.  I think most will find this lower fat healthier Hellmann's offering to be quite good and not sacrificing in flavor in any way.  But as I said, with mayonnaise, to each their own.  Also with any version made to be healthier or lower in fat the taste just won't be exactly like with 100% natural mayonaisse for most.  I highly recommend this and as one choosing to eat healthier am thrilled to find a mayonnaise product so tasty that is better for me.","5.0","Great tasting mayonnaise that is better for you","1358294400"
"chaos","B003TRFSG2","I will start off by saying I really liked the flavor of this mayo but I feel duped by the name. I ordered this mayonnaise because of the big ""olive oil"" on the label. I like olive oil but I have to admit that I was worried that I may not like it in my mayo but I really wanted to try it. Olive oil has a really distinct flavor and I was worried it would ruin the mayo. I am picky about my mayonnaise. (I only use Hellman's mayonnaise because it is my favorite brand.)Anyway, to my surprise, I really liked this mayo. It tasted nice and tangy with no overpowering flavor of olive oil. In fact, I couldn't really taste the olive oil at all. So, I checked the label and found that soybean oil comes before olive oil on the ingredients list. There is no way of knowing the exact ratio they used, however, because of the lack of olive oil flavor I would suspect that the percentage of olive oil compared to soybean oil is very, very, very low.  The `Product Features' section of this product say ""now with 50% more olive oil"". Again, this statement is meaningless unless they tell us the actual quantity in there. ""50% more"" of a tiny amount is still a tiny amount. Instead, give us a meaningful measurement. Tell us was percent of the oil used in this mayo is olive oil.A really nice thing about this mayo is that it is lower in calories. It contains 60 calories per Tbs compared to 90 calories per Tbs of their regular mayo.","4.0","Not much olive oil in it, but still good","1359504000"

"Autumn","B003X7S45U","Fall is my favorite season and pumpkin spice coffee/lattes are basically my favorite thing on planet earth. While I can't say that this bag of coffee is going to completely keep me away from Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, it'll definitely reduce the amount trips that I make to those places. At around ten bucks for a 1 pound bag, my wallet is grateful. You can spend anywhere from $2-5 on some variety of pumpkin drink from a coffee shop, so that's somewhere around 2-5 cups of coffee. In one pot of coffee brewed at home you'll get more cups of pumpkin deliciousness than you would ever for the same price of this entire bag at Starbucks!Really though, this coffee is delicious. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and I was worried that the vanilla would outweigh the pumpkin or that (as other reviews stated) it would taste more like pie spices than pumpkin, but I think this is a perfect blend of vanilla, pumpkin, and spice.My only gripe is that the bag was nearly impossible to open. It was super-duper air sealed shut, which is good because it kept it really fresh but fighting with it for 15 minutes to get it open wasn't fun! I ended up having to splice it open with a knife. Aside from that, there's nothing bad I can say about this product. The coffee is delicious and smooth. I will definitely be repurchasing through the fall and winter months - possibly beyond that! Three or four months of the year is NOT enough enough time for pumpkin coffee consumption!(While you need espresso to make an actual latte out of this, brewing a stronger pot and getting aIKEA Produkt Milk Frotherwill give your cup of coffee a thicker, fuller latte-ish texture :) Mmmm)","5.0","So good and major money saver","1379462400"

The flavor is definitely pomegranate so if you like that flavor, you'll be happy with this. I thought this had a teeny medicinal flavor, but I think that is sometimes true of the flavor anyway. The chew was on the chewy end of the licorice twist range, but not unpleasantly so. The twists are shorter than typical, and each stick is about 25 calories, with zero fat and 5mg of sodium. Made in Mexico with organic ingredients. Based on the success of this flavor I'll definitely try the tangerine.","4.0","decent licorice, interesting flavor","1311638400"

When a 5 year old excitedly asks for a cookie, takes a small nibble, all the excitement vanishes, then he hands the cookie back to you, you know there is something not quite right.For me, it was the texture.  The entire cookie seems to be mushy, as the cookie part is so thin as to not provide much in the way of a satisfying crunch.  It's almost like eating a somewhat gritty York Peppermint Patty, just not as minty tasting (and the fudge/chocolate isn't as good as York, now that I think about it.)For me (and my 5 year old), we're going to stick with our Oreo's...orNewman's Own Organics Newman O's,  (Original) Creme Filled Chocolate Cookies, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)to be exact.

"FLYingG0D","B003XV8XK2","These are wonderful cookies! The size is about that of a typical Oreo cookie, but a little flatter. The cookie itself is composed of a crispy chocolate cookie that is thinner than the typical chocolate cookie used, but has taller ridges on the outside. The inside is filled with white mint creme. The white mint creme has a strong mint flavor, and adds a nice soft contrast to the crispy chocolate cookie.The outside coating of chocolate is also quite a nice change in the traditional Oreo cookie I am used to. It certainly adds more chocolate to balance out the chocolate/mint ratio, and also keeps the whole cookie from making crumbs. These can be eaten with little worry about making a mess!The packaging consisted of a molded plastic tray filled with cookies, sealed in a plastic bag, and inside of a thin cardboard box (the type used for cereal, but smaller). The tray contains 21 slots for cookies, and mine had 20 cookies in it. All the cookies appeared perfectly formed, without any defects from shipping.I am a fan of Chocolate and Mint, and some of my favorite chocolate is Mint flavored chocolate. So, this new Mint Oreo Fudge Cremes snack was very awesome! The mint was not overpowered by the chocolate. Actually, if anything, it might be a little on the strong side! The crispy cookie makes them more enjoyable to eat then simple chocolate, and the chocolate coating really takes care of the chocolate craving!

Nothing over the top in my opinion, but he just loves it.

"1","B003YVTF30","Needless to say this is great coffee, and I'm a coffee snob.Right now I have coffee (both roasted, and not roasted) from several countries, including 100% Kona, and 100% Jamaican Blue Mountain, I like this Tim Horton's blend the best.Also, this is a great grind for the best way to brew coffee ever, percolated in an aluminum pot, (my favorite pot is a Wear-Ever from the 40's/50's).I have every method available for brewing coffee and I do mean that literally, and perked coffee in an aluminum pot makes the best tasting coffee ever.A close second is slow dripping by hand, and third is my Bunn spray/drip maker, all the other methods I have make the worst tasting coffee.  I use them occasionally, and simply wind up throwing out the coffee as I just can't drink it...the worst of the worst tasting coffee is from a vacuum pot, or for that matter any glass pot (for brewing) period!I also have a glass, and a stainless steel percolator but they have become dust collectors, coffee tastes horrible when brewed in either glass, or stainless steel.BTW/ Don't always listen to online opinions concerning either perked coffee, or using an aluminum coffee pot, as people tend to be like sheep following one another, or behave like parrots and simply reiterate the majority opinion. Most people I've talked to that bad mouth perked coffee have never even tasted perked coffee, that's a fact, they simply parrot the majority, christian's tend to follow the others like lost sheep the most.The water does not boil when you percolate coffee, as when using a glass percolator you can see the water percolating way before it starts to boil, also as the water travels up, the water very slightly cools.  What you have to do as soon as it starts to percolate is to monitor the heat, lower the heat, and let it gently perk for about 6 to 8 min. I will admit that you have to monitor the process, but it is so, so worth it.I will say that I don't cook with aluminum, and there's a very scientific reason for brewing coffee in an aluminum pot, but this is not the place to get into it.Grinding the beans to the best coarseness for percolating can sometimes be a pain, (well not that big of a pain), but still I thought I would try this coffee out.Perfect, perfect coffee, at a perfect grind using the best method for brewing coffee and I have a winner.","5.0","Great coffee","1345507200"

"Chandler","B003ZFG7E0","irst of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.I do like the same company's SUGAR in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose.Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it. Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?Huh-uh.You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.Superb huh?Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.Not so fast.I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter. I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.So that got me thinking...I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.It is 1.75 ounces.I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.But, wait...one more thing...Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too. Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...It wouldn't surprise me.","1.0","Youll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.","1320192000"

I would not consider this price acceptable - the product tastes, nice, but it's not THAT great.I will review and rate this product based on my feelings having paid the lower price.  At first, I enjoyed these snacks a lot - the combination of different snacks in a single box tasted good, and I found them rather addictive.  However, I soon began to find that two of the particular snacks included were a bit too similar for my liking - there are two pretzel-like snacks, they taste almost identical, and I'm not really a huge fan of pretzels.  Also, I didn't really care much for the wheat square snacks, (they didn't have much taste and there were too many of them) which left me with the rice balls (which were nice, but there were hardly any of them in a box), the &#34;bread bits&#34; (which were a bit too hard and crunchy for my liking) and the cheez-its (which I always love.) so, overall, after eating all three boxes, I decided not to re-order.I am now addicted to the Cheez-It Snack Mix, Double Cheese, 9.75-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3) ( http://www.amazon.com/Cheez--Snack-Double-Cheese-9-75-Ounce/dp/B003ZXEBHW/ref=sr_1_6?s=grocery&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1391922901&sr;=1-6&keywords;=cheez+it+mix ) although I won't be buying those from Amazon as they are horribly overpriced.","3.0","Nice, but too many pretzel type snacks","1391817600"

"Jennifer","B0040DWCXG","I researched for what felt like forever to find this. I needed a carb-free way to thicken soups and sauces, as my boyfriend is a strict dieter and bodybuilder. And I love food and flavor!I initially purchased this to thicken Chinese-food style sauces, which I wanted to prepare and keep in the fridge to use as a condiment. Well ha ha the joke was on me, this is impossible. I tried thickening with flour, cornstarch, gelatin, arrowroot powder, and various brands of thickening powders. All of these are either made of carbs or they do funky things when you try to refrigerate them (cornstarch is the worst, it turns into globular goop).When I finally heard about xanthan gum I couldn't find it in my area, or else it was crazy expensive. This is by far the best buy I've found.A word about cooking with Xanathan: You can use it on hot or cold liquids, which is great. However if you aren't stirring constantly - seriously constantly - you will get gross little congealed pellets of the gum. You also can't add it all at once, or you will get big revolting pellets. The best technique I have found (and this does require some ambidextrous coordination) is to put the powder into a salt shaker and sprinkle it over the surface of a liquid, which you are simultaneously whisking. You don't need much - start with about 1/2 teaspoon per 3 cups of liquid, and go up from there. Keep in mind that it will continue to thicken some over the next few hours, but you can always add more then if it doesn't thicken enough.Another method I've heard is to sprinkle the powder over a blender of liquid or water while it is running. Some people even pre-mix it into a paste to add to other liquids later, but I haven't tried that method so I don't know how well it works.If your thickened liquid starts to thin out again (this will take a few weeks, if it happens) it is probably because the powder has gotten congealed around the edges of the container. You can just push that back in and it will re-blend. Otherwise the Xanthan gum stays pretty well bound, keeps food thick, and adds no weird flavor or textures.Give it a try!","5.0","Perfect Solution","1355875200"

I also use it to flavor rice.It says reduced sodium but is still plenty salty, frankly. When I add it to rice cooking water, I don't use additional salt. Learned that the hard way. And I am a salt lover. Can't imagine how salty the regular version must be. Please realize that salt is a preservative and that is no doubt one of the ways this product is kept so tasty: fewer obnoxious preservatives.

"Chandler","B0041CIP3M","Ah, it's the old rule that things that taste good are rarely good for you...well, they can be made healthier but the nutritional label on this one is sketchy.I think it's highly misleading to say a serving size it 2 Tablespoons. You couldn't do anything with 2 Tablespoons of sauce except for put it atop one baby red potato.  However, in just that small of serving size you are already weighing it at 7 grams SATURATED fat and 9 grams total fat.  In those 2 tablespoons you also have 100 calories...this is without the protein and rice you might add as a consumer. Tack on 230 mg of sodium in those two tiny spoonfuls and 3 grams sugar and you are likely to finish this meal wondering why you didn't have a Big Mac.The label says it's ""family size"" and you'd best have a big family who plans on cooking other dishes for dinner if everyone is only supposed to eat 2 Tablespoons.This rates a D minus on the health websites.That said, until you add meat, it has no cholesterol.  There is some good. Unless you, of course, do plan to add meat...then you are consuming basically a Big Mac and fries if you eat normal portions.For me that's just too much. Taste isn't everything...I believe in everything in moderation, but even in moderation with two spoonfuls of sauce you just have too much saturated fat here from the oil.So let's look at the ingredients. Normally coconut milk is used in curry which is a good fat...instead they used PALM OIL (vegetable oil: bad fat) as the main ingredients and then added in the flavor of coconut as a spice:ngredientsRendang Paste (heat sterilized) Vegetable Oil (palm olein), Chili, Galangal, Palm Sugar, Onion,Shallot, Sugar,Pandan Leaf (Pandanus Amaryllifolius), Garlic, Salt, Lemon Grass, Soya Sauce (extract of soya bean, wheat, salt, sugar, carmel color), Fennel, Coriander, Cumin, Kaffer Lime Leaf, Cloves, Turmeric, white Pepper, Cinnamon Prima Coconut Premix (dehydrated) Coconut Milk Powder (coconut milk solids, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate), maltodextrinSo basically this is a big ol' packet of vegetable oil with seasonings to make it taste more like a regular curry...and a whole lotta sugar to make ya love it.Not my thing.","2.0","9 grams  fat in 2 Tablespoons...and lots of sugar. This is mostly palm oil and seasonings.","1342656000"
"Jennifer","B0041CIP3M","I love quick and easy meals like this, so was excited to try it. And it was really quite good. I took the advice from the other reviews on how to best do the coconut part, and it came out wonderful. The only reason for knocking off a star is that it feels like there are pieces of grass in it and it doesn't have a good mouth feel. I know it's a necessary spice, but it's just a little off-putting. I think, though, if I use more veggies, it might hide the texture more...so if I buy these again, I'll try it that way. But it's still worth buying.","4.0","Restaurant meal from a box!","1367107200"
"jt","B0041CIP3M","Felt a bit like I was making a special Hamburger Helper especially when I added the powdered coconut mix.  Besides that this was very good.  Really enjoyed this over some brown rice.  Lots of yummy sauce.  Has just a slight touch of spiciness that kept my  young kids (3 & 5) from eating a full serving but they did like it and had a few bites.  I do think a much of the taste of the dish overall will depend on the type of beef used and how you cook it.  Certainly don't want to have meat be too chewy.  I would be tempted to try the mix with chicken in the future.","5.0","Tasty","1331769600"
"LD","B0041CIP3M","This is a great tasting Rendang with the flavors of the spices coming through. First some comments to earlier reviews. Usually the amount of lemon grass is more pronounced, with some chefs preferring to include a lot more pieces than this mix has in it. If you wish to cut the sweetness or have a stronger lemon bite, I suggest that you add some lemon juice.To add volume and vegetables to the dish without changing the flavor, I chunked up a can of whole bamboo shoots and cut a whole red bell pepper into chunks. This tasted great on a full plate of rice and made 6 large servings- creating an all-in-one dish and cost effective. If you want something crunchy, small pieces of celery would do fine. If you would prefer something soft, you can use a can of straw mushrooms.I prefer to cut vegetables into 1/3"" cubes and meat into 3/4"" strips so that every forkful has all the ingredients when the sauce is potent like this one. I did use a full cup of water and mixed the coconut before adding the seasoning. After reaching boiling, I added the vegetables and meat.","5.0","Comments from a gourmet chef","1328572800"
"Patricia","B0041CIP3M","My husband and I agreed that this is one of the best curries we've had in a long time. Curries vary greatly and so does individual taste. We particularly liked Prima Taste's Rendang Curry because it was not very hot, but had just enough heat to make it interesting, and the subtle coconut flavor. The spices blend well together and nothing overpowers the others. And, it smells wonderful when cooking! It tasted fresh, probably since it was not just a dry mix.Making this was super easy. Using a whisk, I mixed the paste and dry coconut packages together along with the water, then added the browned meat. I did have to add water every so often as the meat simmered in the mix, but, I was using 2 lbs of big chunks of meat. If you use smaller cuts that cook to tender more quickly or less meat, you might not have to. I liked the large pieces of spices in the sauce, but others might prefer to pick them out. We added green peas to the dish just before serving it over rice. Chopped peanuts might make a nice topping, and you can use your imagination for other additions.","5.0","Delicious and easy!","1328227200"
"Rachel","B0041CIP3M","Having only tried Thai food fairly recently (within the last couple of years), I was eager to try this kit out at home.  I knew it was likely that it would be out of my diet comfort zone, and it really was, but I decided to try it anyway.We made it with lean beef, but if I were to make it again I might try it with bison, chicken, or maybe even tofu.  I thought it had a nice balance of flavors, but it could use a little more spice for my taste.  I realize that to make it marketable to the masses, they can't make it too spicy - I'm just saying that if you do like your food spicy, you should anticipate using a little hot sauce; and if you don't like it too spicy you should be okay.  All in all, I'd recommend this to someone who likes curries and doesn't really care about fat intake.  The fact that it's a bit pricey and I do care about fat intake is what makes me say I wouldn't get this again, but it's just a bad product for most curry lovers.","3.0","Pretty good, but I wouldn't get it again.","1349308800"
"LD","B0041CIR62","I regularly eat brown rice and whole wheat pasta so I was interested to see how this would taste.The first thing I noticed was that it was very thin and it resembled oriental translucent cellophane noodles.

I tasted the noodles before adding seasoning and it doesn't have any distinguishing taste. But on the other side, it is like Tofu, in that it takes on the taste of the seasonings and sauce that you use with it.Would I buy it again? No. It's too expensive for what you get.

You would definitely keep feeling the ginger taste in your mouth after you stop drinking.

"ephemeral","B0044CPA28","Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal consists of corn flakes covered in honey and bits of peanuts.  It is somewhat crunchy, although not any more so than most other cereals.  Compared to a lot of other breakfast cereals, it doesn't have large amounts of vitamins or minerals, but it does have 25% of the daily recommended values of vitamins B6 and B12, as well as iron.  There are also small amounts of fiber and protein.The key characteristic of this cereal is that it is almost overwhelmingly sweet, with sugar making up more than 35% of each serving, by weight.  The second ingredient listed on the box is sugar, and is also contains molasses, honey, and high fructose corn syrup.  It is so sweet that I could only just make out the tastes of honey and peanuts.  There is no way that I could ever eat this for breakfast, but it does make a nice dessert in very small amounts.  If you're looking for a very sweet, sugary cereal, this might be a good choice for you, but I probably won't be buying it again.","3.0","Too Sweet for Breakfast","1296691200"
"Sadie","B0044CPA28","I presumed two things about the name of this cereal:  1) there would be nuts in it, and 2) the nuts would make it crunchy.

My teeth hurt eating this cereal it has so much sugar on it.Nuts?  Not in my bowl of cereal there weren't.  It appears that they covered the flakes with a mixture of sugar and nut dust and that's about all the nuts you're going to get in this cereal.  Unless they forgot to put the nuts in my box, you won't be finding any in yours either.Thumbs down because the last thing we need is another sugary cereal, because it's not new as the box implies, and because there are no nuts in it.","1.0","Just sugared Corn Flakes with nut dust on them","1296000000"
"Carol","B0044MTGHI","Coconut oil is actually really good for you. Every few days I use about half a teaspoon of coconut oil as a skin moisturizer; my skin has become buttery soft from using coconut oil as a moisturizer, but I err on the side of caution because once my skin broke out horrifically when I used coconut oil everyday as a moisturizer. Coconut oil is also good for softening up rough patches of skin and for people suffering from yeast infections. I also use it as a leave-in conditioner as it helps a lot with frizz.I finally drew up the nerve to cook and eat with coconut oil a few months ago, and my opinion is anything cooked in coconut oil tastes spectacular. If I'm eating something that wasn't cooked in coconut oil, I'll add a few tablespoons over the whole dish, much to the disdain of my mother. Drinks made with coconut oil are delicious, very filling and extra energizing as well. If you don't like the taste of coconuts in savory dishes, this is probably not an oil you want to cook with.","5.0","Coconut oil: Good for what ails ya!","1332806400"

"jpr","B0044QYG2E","The first thing to know about these candies is that they are not gummies in the typical sense.  I'd classify them more as jellies.  They are much softer than gummi bears, so soft that they would all be merged together into one blob by the time you bought them, _except_ that they have a stiffer ""shell"" on the outside to help them keep their shapes and remain separate.  That part works fine, and even in warmer temperatures they hold up well and don't get sticky.The combination of the stiffer outer shell and soft center (similar center consistency to sunkist fruit gems) make the overall texture kind of interesting, and I think it might grow on me over time, but I still prefer the good old Gold Bears I grew up on.  For a change, these would be good on occasion though.  They also don't stick to your teeth like Jujyfruits do, so that's another plus.The flavors are pretty good, and a little more interesting than typical gummi flavors, but it seems like there's something missing in the flavor mix, perhaps another tart flavor in there would better round things out, or a more intense flavor of some kind.Of the four family members that tried them, one hated them, two loved them, and I'm still kind of on the fence, so I'd rate them 3-3.5 stars overall.  Good, but not exceptional unless you have a particular liking for the texture and flavors, or if you remember them from childhood or a memorable trip overseas, etc.Also note that the packages I received (Aug 2011) actually said ""Made in Spain,"" while the Amazon product description still says Made in Germany as of right now.

"csm","B004776JL6","If you like your coffee strong, and I mean REALLY strong, try this version.  I think Green Mountain does a superb job of the k-cups and even bagged coffee (you can get those on their website).  But this one, well, if you split open the K-cup, you can put it in a regular coffee pot and get a 6-cup pot from it, slow brewed. Keruig works with a LOT of coffee - that's the purpose but you're still using a bunch of coffee.  That said, although I love strong coffee, I have a 20 ounce mug, use one of these on the largest mug setting, then hit the espresso size TWICE and it still is strong (but I take coffee black).  Keep that in mind.  Anyway, it has an amazing flavor, aroma (it WILL smell up your kitchen rather nicely!), and just overall, one of Green Mountain's best.  My favorite of theirs is still the Pumpkin and Vermont Country Blend.  Highly recommend!","5.0","Great coffee, but quite strong","1361577600"

The place the noodle really stood out as an improvement over ramen is in a miso soup.  i do not really use the seasoning packet at least in the oriental flavor.  To describe what it is taste likes is not quite that easy it just that the seasoning packet does not have a big oh that taste like this sensation but more of an all around mix flavors that one would be quick to think of when one thinks of east asian flavors. If you can image all those different flavors thrown together with little bit of everything but nothing very distinctive or overpowering, well that's what you have here.  The flavor pack is by no means bad, but I did not buy these noodle for the flavor pack.  I bring my own soup to pour over my noodles.One last thing I was a little nervous about buy these noodles, with some of the reviewers listing sour smell or taste and/or the noodles falling apart, well I experienced no such thing and I have gone through half the pack now. I wonder if they might have gottten a bad batch or more likely that the noodle were cooked the wrong way.

"Briana","B00482TD04","---2012 November, 11---The first plant died, the shipper sent me a replacement... it was too wet and had already started rotting when I got it.  The soil these spider plants are in is not at all appropriate, it holds way too much water.  I saved this one by letting it dry out completely and then watering extremely scarcely.  I've been watering it less than once a week, and only a trickle of water at the base of the plant, and it's finally stopped losing leaves to the rot, and is showing new growth.In short, this is the most temperamental spider plant I have ever owned.  I didn't think there was such a thing!---2013, October, 8---Unfortunately I have to take back the 'healthy' claim.  After the first week, most of the tips of the leaves were going yellow-brown and dying, which spider plants will do if they are stressed.  I figured it was probably from the shipping, no big deal.Then the bottom leaves started dying, going completely brown and dead, from the base out.  Not good.  I finally got a chance to pull it out of its pot today, washed all the dirt off... about 1/3 of the roots were rotted away completely, another 1/3 had started to rot from the tip.  I removed all the rotting matter I could I'm going to try and salvage this poor thing.I use spider plants as my go to plant to give people who don't normally grow indoor plants(or plants at all) because they're so easy to take care of and impossible to kill.  I wasn't expecting having trouble with this plant!----My plant is just about the same size as the one pictured, lovely variegated leaves, and arrived intact and healthy.  I'll be moving it to a larger pot as soon as it has a chance to rest from being stuffed into a box with no light for several days, as it could use the room already to grow!","1.0","Plant arrived looking healthy... and quickly started dying.","1380240000"

I find it a little pricey and not all items made healthier tasted good to me.  Let's start with the VEGETABLE CHIPS.  They taste fine as long as you like pepper.  The pepper taste is very strong.  These are gluten free which is great and have no trans fat but there is still 7 grams of fat per serving.  The Cinnabon ALMONDS are tasty but very hard on the teeth.  The coating is very hard to bite.  And the gluten free Annie's BUNNY COOKIES just don't work for me.  There is just no taste to these cookies.What is very succesful for me is the organic GUMMIE FRUIT SNACKS.  Very tasty and soft, easy to chew.  Also the GO PICNIC ready meal is very succesful with the tasty turkey stick and barbecue chips.  The chocolate is also very tasty.  This box set is definitely worth a shot.

"csm","B004BKHX1Y","I was actually quite afraid to try these graham crackers. You know, order them online and experience the thrill of receiving cracker dust upon arrival. As a rule, I do not buy any other grahams except for Nabisco's Honey Maid brand because, they're just the best and always have been in our opinion. This Back to Nature brand includes unusual flavors like this apple/cinnamon and they're just wonderful! They're not overly sweet, have just the right amount of flavoring, and even contain large pieces of oatmeal which are conspicuously displayed throughout the product. And yes, kids do love them, they're the object of competition in this house - they're really that good.For the particulars, they are 100% whole grain with 19g per serving (2 full crackers), naturally flavored, and contain no artifical preservatives, flavors or colors, no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils. They DO contain 2g of protein and 8g of sugar and 2.5g of fat. Calories are 55 per double cracker, and the total fat from calories is 20.So, grab a glass of milk for dunking and try these. You will not be disappointed! Wonder how they would be as a crust for pumpkin cheesecake? Hmmm, sounds like an idea! Oh, in case you're wondering, mine DID arrive with broken pieces, quite a few of them actually. However, since I only received one package to assess them and write this review, they were only shipped in a bubble mailer. If you order them on Amazon, they ship them in boxes of 6 so they would arrive in a more protective carton. Highly recommend!","5.0","Pretty good crackers","1298505600"

"booksy","B004DIR3TQ","I love dark chocolate, but I think my tastes are a little too pedestrian because this chocolate was just too bitter and not sweet enough for me. I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of ""more is better"" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%.","3.0","For Dark Aficionados Only","1322179200"
"LD","B004DIR3TQ","I've never tried this brand of chocolate before. I prefer semi-sweet so this was a real treat to be able to try it out. Everyone's taste is a little different so let me describe the flavor as very close to Nestle's Semi-sweet morsels used in chocolate chip cookies. Scharffen Berger is just a little bit sweeter (not quite the sour bite I'm used to).I did not taste the honey but I did have an aftertaste of citrus. Its hard to describe. Its like if you eat a fresh ripe strawberry, after a few chews you get a little twang after you notice the sweetness.Good chocolate is expensive so I think the price is reasonable at around $3 per 3 ounce bar. Although there is a cross-cut design on the top, it does not help if you want to make specific sized pieces.","5.0","Oh, this is good!!!","1320019200"
"Poogy","B004DIR3TQ","Scharffen Berger is known for being high quality chocolate, preferred by some chefs for baking.  Although some of the very dark chocolates can not only be bitter but one-dimensional and chalky, this one has a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness and also a fruitiness that I enjoy.  If you're used to Hershey's, you'll be surprised that chocolate has a lot more complexity than emerges from any of the mass-produced, very sweet, waxy candy bar-style chocolates. Although I won't deny I love the taste, I eat as much chocolate as I do these days mostly for its purported health benefits, so I usually eat unsweetened (or baking) chocolate.  70% cacao is actually at the sweeter end of the spectrum for me, but I know some people who wrinkle their nose at it as ""too bitter.""

So, a word of advice, it doesn't come out of the container until you squeeze it, so definitely turn it upside down before squeezing.I am a water drinker and try to avoid caffeine.  I do, however, enjoy having a little flavor in my drink, occasionally.  I am limited in my choices.  I had seen the ads for Mio and had picked it up in the store, but didn't see whether or not there was any caffeine.  The description I read on Amazon said there was none, so I decided to take a chance.  I also liked the no calorie part.Once I had the Mio in the glass of water, I was able to try it out.  I started with one squeeze and stirred it up.  The color was very pale, for tea.  The smell was peachy, but not like a real peach.  More like a peach fragrance in a lotion or candle.  The taste was pretty weak, so I put in another squeeze.  The smell and taste was now stronger and the color was a light pinky-brown.  The taste is pretty artificial.  Tastes like there are a lot of chemicals used to achieve this taste.  there is a label, which did not pull off cleanly, over my ingredients list, but from what I can see, there is a good reason it tastes like chemicals.","3.0","Watch out!","1328054400"

I don't like keeping Crystal Light packets in my purse because I have had them open up, then had to get all the powder out.  I also like the fact that you can put as much or as little flavoring in as you want.  Sometimes we have the smaller bottles of water in our house, and then you have to try to estimate half of a packet, and often end up too little or too much - and then you have to keep the halfway full package around until you need it.  With this, you could have any size serving of water and flavor it just as much or little as you like.  I also particularly like this flavor.","5.0","I like this even better than Crystal Light!","1321488000"
"reg","B004E4EBMG","I drink primarily water.  Occasionally, I like a little flavor.  I do not like caffeine and prefer no calories.  Nothing on the bottle says no caffeine, but the product description I read says there is none.  The instructions say to use one squeeze per 8 oz.  I used 2 in about 22 oz.  The color is an orangy-brown.  The smell is faint and so are the flavors.  I hesitate to use more because it is already sweeter than I prefer.  The peach taste is light and pretty artificial tasting.  I detect no mango.I also received theMIO Liquid Peach Tea, 1.62-Ounce, (Pack of 4).  I made a bit of a mess the first time I used it because I was afraid it would all dump out if I turned it upside down over my glass.  When I squeezed it, it went everywhere.  It does not dump out when you turn it upside down.  It stays in until you squeeze it.  The packaging works better than then what's inside.","3.0","Can't taste the mango.","1328054400"

I hate that!Mi0 is very good, you can add a bit or a lot, but just a little bit really sweetens up your drink and has a lot of flavor.  It mixes up nicely since its already a liquid.I know some commented on the concern of certain ingredients in Mi0.  Frankly I dont think its a bit issue.  People drink soda by the gallons, this is a lot better then soda.This is like anything and drink it in moderation.  I have several bottles of water a day of water, but I just use 1 with my favorite Mi0 mix.Wonderful drink.Its a bit pricy, I am not to sure why.

They're, as the name suggests, thin cookies with a nice bit of crunch to them, but they're not hard at all. They have a hint of sweetness without being too sweet, and the citrus gives them a nice bit of tartness. The dried cranberries add a good, chewy texture to the crispy cookie.

"FLYingG0D","B004FEN3GA","These are very tasty crackers! They are about 3/16"" thick with 2 1/2"" diameter. They are sturdy enough to spread a decently thick cheese on, or can be topped with other items. I like how they are less likely to break than many other crackers intended for serving with cheese and other toppings.Normally when I see the name ""Newtons"" I think of the Fig Newtons, and expect a moist and soft snack. These are not soft & moist. The difference is comparable to the difference between soft cookies and the stiff ones. That was the main thing that was different from my mental image of what these thins would be like. However, they are not too dry. They have a bit of moisture content so they hold up quite well.These thins taste great! The brown sugar is more of the background base flavor that one would expect to taste, and the blueberry gives it the flavor mixture that really makes these a pleasure to eat! I have to say, this mixture is quite excellent! It is not too strong, so I could eat a whole package without getting tired of the flavor, and yet each cracker has enough flavor that I can eat just one and be pleased.Newton's Fruit Thins are a delightful snack, with a perfect blend of maple sugar and blueberry flavoring. They are nice and sturdy (not a single one arrived cracked) and the price is quite excellent! I find them great for snacking, and they are actually decent at curbing hunger. I was very hungry just a while ago, and snacked on a few and am fine now.","5.0","Excellent Crackers!","1311897600"
"Grace","B004FEN3GA","I'm crunching on one of these biscuit crackers as I'm typing this.  Not quite wafer thin, these Newtons Fruit Thins are pretty yummy.  Not too sweet, yet flavorful.  What I like about them is that you can actually taste and see the actual dried blueberries in each cracker, and three of them only have 5% DV of saturated fat.  That means you can eat up to three without feeling too guilty about it.  The packaging is attractive, with an easy-to-seal opening.  Each bag contains 30 cookies too; a good number.  I can see this being a painless, healthier alternative to actual cookies.  Good job, Nabisco!","4.0","Good Snack for Health-Conscious Folk","1304121600"
"Orianna","B004FEN3GA","I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these new cookies, and to be honest, I have mixed feelings about them. They're thin and crunchy, much more like crackers than cookies. The texture is very similar to graham crackers, actually, and they're not very sweet. They have tiny dried blueberries in them, along with brown sugar for flavoring. I would not have called them ""cookies"", because they're much more like crackers. The flavor is a bit odd. I don't know how to describe it. Rather bland, actually. My favorite part is the dried blueberries, so it's a shame they're so tiny! These cookies make for a quick breakfast, or a mid-afternoon snack. Just make sure you have something to drink, as well, to wash them down.The ingredient list appears mostly ""normal"", without a lot of weird stuff: enriched flour, whole grain wheat flour, soybean and/or palm oil, sugar, rolled oats, dried blueberries, brown sugar, flax seeds, fructose, salt, baking soda, soy lecithin, and natural flavor. They're somewhat low in fat (5g) and they've got some fiber in them (2g), zero trans fat and zero cholesterol, and 8g of sugars.I would hesitantly recommend them, but I have a feeling that many people will be as ambivalent about them as I am. They're not great, they're not horrible. They're just sort of . . . eh. On the other hand, I do keep eating them. So perhaps they grow on you? I can't see kids enjoying them, it's definitely a more ""mature"" kind of cookie. My husband feels the same way--he doesn't love them, but doesn't hate them, either.","3.0","Blueberries and Brown Sugar","1304812800"
"Tori","B004FEN3GA","Before requesting these, I read a few reviews because the last time I requested a snack via Amazon Prime, said item supposedly had a laxative effect. Like many other people, I originally thought that these Fruit Thins (despite the name) would have a fruit filling within. I'm actually glad they don't. I'm also glad I chose this flavor over the figs, though that is the next flavor I do want to try.Opening the bag was extremely easy. While some of the cookies were broken, it wasn't too big of a deal for me. What's even better is the twisty tie attached to the plastic wrapper. Convenience, much?The cookies are thin crisps with little pieces of blueberries scattered throughout. They're crunchy, and while the initial bite was weird, I soon adjusted to the taste and fell in love with each bite. It didn't take me long to devour two cookies.The serving size suggests 3 cookies, and I had to force myself to stop eating these. I could easily pig out on these sometime, they were that enjoyable. And, surprisingly enough, my mother enjoyed them too. She even said she would be willing to buy these in the future.I'll have to agree with her.

There are eight crackers packaged together in plastic, and each box contains 6 little packs of the crackers.  To me, this doesn't really serve any purpose and accomplishes nothing other than increasing the packaging.  I didn't find the size any more convenient or easy to eat, and I'm really not happy with the extra packaging.

"Cher","B004IXYLJ6","I have used several types of brownie mixes over the years, this is the BEST that I have ever used, and the largest boxed mix.  My only issue is that I live alone so making the full box is a bit much for me.  So I break it in 1/3s and as well as the cut the added amounts in 1/3s, water and oil, except for the eggs.  (I use a 1 small egg with each 1/3 of the mixture, as I mix and bake.)  I works well for me, so that I can enjoy a fresh warm batch of brownies when I desired. (I could and would love to each a FULL batch, but I believe it would not be wise for me to do so.  But that doesn't mean that I don't want to, or even long to do so.)This is a moist chewy chocolate brownie mix that taste like scratch made.  The price is also GOOD.  I would and gladly do, suggest that others try this brand.  ENJOY!","5.0","The BEST boxed mix ever!","1341619200"

It just doesn't rise evenly.  It bakes OK, but it's misshapen and makes weird slices.

I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my kids give them a try. One of my sons didn't like them at all. The other son (who has more of a sweet-tooth) liked them a little. He liked them enough that he's going to eat more, but told me not to bring home any more. He'd rather have the original Oreos. If he was in the mood for PB & chocolate, he'd just rather have a Reese's.The other thing I'd like to point out is that I wouldn't really even consider these ""cookies"". They contain more PB & chocolate than cookie. The cookie wafer is really thin and is just overpowered by the other 2 ingredients.

The thin peanut butter layer is smooth and creamy, but leaves a faintly artificial aftertaste. They reminded me slightly of the old school Girl Scout cookies called Hoedowns (now called Tagalongs) but not nearly as thick or as rich tasting. Maybe if it had a thicker cookie layer it would taste more like an Oreo.So overall, three stars for a ""meh"" rating.

I disagreed with my husband, and felt that there was no comparison to Reeses Peanut Butter cups, which we both love. Too sweet for my taste, and (3) cookies were 170 calories (and they are very thin; about the thickness of the Girl Scout Thin Mint cookie).

"lizellis","B004JGWU8Q","First let me say that neither I nor anyone I know has ever considered brownies to be health food.  To approach an analysis of this product from that perspective is just plain unrealistic.  Yes, they contain sugar and fat and carbs; they're brownies!  That being said,  as desserts go, Snackwells are fairly light in calories and if eaten in moderation as is presumably intended, most people will not suffer any harm.  If any or all of these ingredients presents a problem, perhaps you should look elsewhere to satisfy your snacking urges.I found the little bites to be very dense and chewy and not overly sweet, a tasty occasional treat.  The chocolate taste really comes through.  It's dark and rich, a rather sophisticated chocolate rather than the chalky, milky chocolate so common in commercial products.Yes, I've had better brownies and my homemade are better yet, but for a quick snack without a lot of guilt, I really like Snackwell Brownie Bites.","4.0","Delicious, fudgy treats","1308614400"

There are not a lot of choices out there when it comes to low calorie drinks or flavor packets so I was excited to find this option.  I was a afraid they would lack in flavor but honestly the flavor is great, my personal preference being the Sumatra Dragonfruit and Brasilla Blueberry flavors, which I enjoy more than the more tart clementine flavor which literately tastes just like a clementine squeezed into juice with a sour overtone.  This variety pack is a great way to explore the product and decide your personal preferences of which flavors you will like. And if you like all of them, this is a great choice to get variety.

Picture a creamy dressing like Ranch with the smoky taste of chipotle peppers and other seasonings.At first I couldn't figure out how to use it. The bottle depicts it being used on a taco, but I prefer fresh salsas for that purpose. But I've used it in several meals with great success: as a condiment for broiled meats; as a dressing on sandwiches; and to add an ""adult"" flavor to the chicken nuggets I was forced to eat when my kids wanted them for lunch! I think it would also make a good dipping sauce for fresh vegetables, chicken fingers, maybe fried zucchini...? It's the kind of sauce you'd want to use in small amounts on the side, rather than pouring it over a whole salad or even a whole taco.A worthwhile addition to your stock of condiments.","4.0","Not What I Expected, But Good","1314748800"
"jpr","B004JRKEH4","This is a smoky, creamy, and just very mildly spicy sauce.  If that's what you're looking for you'd likely enjoy it a lot, but for me, it made figuring out just what to do with it a little difficult.  Typically when I make tacos, etc, I just use salsa, sour cream, and sometimes hot sauce, so I'm struggling a bit to figure out where this fits in exactly.  It tastes good, but seems almost unnecessary.One use that seems to work pretty well is adding it to a taco salad.  It's kind of a nice addition to keep the flavors a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that.  It could also add a bit of variety to sandwiches if one is in the mood for something a little different than the norm; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar.  I might also try it for dipping chicken nuggets or wings, etc.Overall it seems like a pretty good product, but not something I'd be likely to use daily or even a couple times a week, so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably won't buy a 6-pack of them.  I would rate it perhaps 4 stars on taste but it loses a few points for versatility since it's not really hot sauce, taco sauce, salsa, sandwich spread, or salad dressing, it's kind of something else that I have trouble classifying.","3.0","Pretty good, but not sure what to do with it yet","1319068800"

"Jennifer","B004K00DGC","In all honesty, I don't usually consume energy drinks, but as the mother of an active toddler, some days I really feel like I could use one...so I was intrigued to try this version.My experience went like this:After the first sip: ""Wow, this REALLY tastes like apple! And it's pretty good!""Second sip: ""Yeah, this isn't too bad and it's pretty fizzy.""Third sip: ""The apple is a little fake tasting and it's too carbonated.""Fourth sip: ""Do I really have to finish this whole can?"" (I decided yes, I did, since I had to review it.)Fifth sip: ""I bet this would go down a lot better mixed with some vodka."" :)So I finished the can over about 20-30 minutes while packing for a road trip later that afternoon. During the entire four-hour car ride and rest of the evening, I felt no energy kick at all. AT ALL. And the caffeine apparently had no effect on my ability to fall asleep that night, either (thankfully).So this energy drink was a total dud for me. Since I wasn't used to drinking them, I really thought it would affect me in a very noticeable way--and it didn't.

It definitely cleared the fog on a day when I'd left the house before my usual 3 small doses of coffee. On the other hand, I came wide awake at 3am the night following its consumption. That almost never happens to me, but I can't necessarily blame it on Jamba Juice based on one can. Figure an 8 oz. cup of coffee has an average of 133 mg. caffeine with a range of 102 to 200 mg., and an 8 oz. cup of tea has an average of 53 mg. caffeine with a range of 40 to 120.Now the taste: Very pleasing. A plus here is real fruit juice that tastes a bit like the semi-hard cider I used to enjoy, of course without any alcohol but rather with light carbonation. It is lightly sweetened. The ingredient list: Apple juice and lemon juice (water, juice concentrates), water, apple puree, natural flavor, caffeine, extract of stevia (natural sweetener), carbonation added - this taken directly from the can.A down side is 90 calories for this small drink.

I found my batch a little bit on the oily side (some chips were a bit saturated), and I prefer them lighter and drier, and maybe a tiny bit less salty, but no one else who tried them at home agreed--they all thought they were fine in salt and felt good enough about the oil being from olives. they are very flavorful and great on their own, but I also enjoy pouring a bag into a bowl and sprinkling it with a pinch of a favorite spice blend, and the blends I am currently playing with, and which I love, already have a tiny bit of himalayan pink salt in them (btw, I highly recommend Teeny Tiny Spices). ; )  I like to get to know new spice blends I purchase by having a bit with some potato chips to get a feel for their flavor profiles and imagine what they might pair well with, but, like anyone else, I really just enjoy snacking too. : ) the individual bags in this 24-bag shipment are very tiny, something like the free bag of chips you get on the side when you order at Cosi, when you don't grab the baby carrots. despite the oiliness of my first batch, though, I have just reordered and am just hoping that my next batch is less so. TJ's has a pretty good bag of olive oil potato chips too, but my last few bags from them were all swimming in oil, and so I turned to Amazon. I remembered this Good Health brand from back when I was in school and was hooked on their rosemary chips (which they sell here too, btw). for a bulk order, though, I can easily just grind up some dried rosemary from my window sill over some of these and have my rosemary chips, or, alternately, grind some pepper over my bowl. these chips are very versatile.

"Charlotte","B004LA1LKI","Don't get me wrong - these are NOT buttery flaky Ritz like their regular crackers. These are healthy. Really healthy! So don't get all excited if you think they are going to be cheesy, guilt free versions of regular Ritz crackers. They are not that at all.What they ARE is hearty, tasty, high fiber multigrain crackers with some really sharp cheddar in the middle. The cheese is not creamy, but it's not as powdery as most ready to eat cheese crackers usually are. The crackers are a little hard, about middle-of-the-road as far as multigrain crackers go.What I LOVED about these crackers was their flavor and their fiber. Each individually wrapped bar has a generous 5g of fiber, or 20% of the minimum daily recommendation. It's not soluble fiber, but it's still a great addition to any American diet. Between the fiber, the 2g protein, and the 7g of fat, these bars wind up being really filling for only 130 calories. They only have 2g sugar, so the calories you're getting are good for sustained energy without any blood sugar spike. With a glass of water or milk, one of these would be great for kicking late afternoon hunger. (Those 100 calorie packs never quite seem to cut it, do they?) The flavor of these crackers is really good! The cheese is sharp and tasty, the crackers have a nice texture and rustic flavor, and overall they are just plain good.I recommend these for anyone looking to add some extra fiber to their diet, cracker lovers, or those who are seeking a more filling (and satisfying) afternoon snack at the office.

I realize we're trying to be healthy here in this product but golly, why does healthy mean ""taste like the box?"" I'm surprised that Ritz has a product like this because all of their other crackers are just awesome!

I guess the good news is that the first ingredient in these is whole grain wheat flour, and each crackerful has 2g of protein and 5g of fiber.  That's good, but the bad news is that one crackerful also packs 130 calories,7 grams of fat, and 210mg of sodium.  I try to make my snack choices count (in terms of nutrition); those calorie, fat, and sodium numbers are a bit too high to make this a ""go to"" snack choice for me.","3.0","Multigrain Lover","1301529600"
"nonpareil","B004LA1LKI","These are OK but nothing to write home about. They are, or may be for some people, fuel for the furnace. Six come individually wrapped in a box, which I find convenient for road food.So you can make a decision, I will give some data. Each large 1-ounce cracker measures 4 3/8"" long by 1 5/8"" wide by 3/16"" high with the filling included. Each contains 130 calories, with 7 grams of fat which is 11% of Daily Value. Also listed are 2 grams of saturated fat which is 10% of Daily Value. (I believe that is included in the total of 7g fat.) The top ingredient is whole grain wheat flour but the next is bleached enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine, mononitrate {vitamin B1}, riboflavin {vitamin B2}, folic acid) which is not whole grain. Nonetheless, the manufacturer states that each of these large crackers contains 5 grams of dietary fiber which is 20% of Daily Value. The filling contains numerous ingredients: sodium phosphate, palm oil, cheddar cheese (pasteurized milk, cheese culture, salt, enzymes) [*NOTE this is the third ingredient behind sodium phosphate and palm oil !*], soybean oil, whey, sugar, corn syrup solids, modified cornstarch, oat fiber, partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, salt, rye, triticale, millet, barley flakes, leavening (baking soda and/or calcium phosphate), cream, maltodextrin, dehydrated buttermilk, disodium phosphate, natural flavor, milkfat, soy lecithin, asiago cheese (cultured milk, enzymes), (again cheddar cheese, same ingredients), tricalcium phosphate, annatto (vegetable color), lactic acid, malted barley and cornstarch. This list is off the box except what I added in [ ]. Don't mean to bore you but some folks like to know what they're buying when they can't actually read the list as when at the supermarket. In terms of multi-grain-ness, the non-wheat grains are WAY down the list so their amounts are small.","3.0","Kraft/Ritz cheese-filled crackers; 130 calories each","1302912000"

"FLYingG0D","B004MO6NI8","Normally, Energy drinks do not do much for me. Actually, most of them either make me sleepier, or leave me with an odd feeling in the stomach and do nothing to improve my energy. I find that most of the powdered or small bottles of Vitamin-B filled energy drink-mix or ""shots"" tend to work better, extending my energy for a longer amount of time. Nothing too amazing, but if I don't feel like I am going to make it through a whole work day, I can take one of those and last through the shift and then some.Then I tried No Fear, ""Super Energy Supplement"" - and I experienced something I had never experienced before! I was not bouncing off the walls, but I went from awfully tired (feeling like I wouldn't last more than half hour before falling asleep) to having plenty of energy for hours and hours and hours! I did not feel too tired to get up and go do work - in fact, I felt like I was full of energy and could do whatever I wanted without worry of tiring myself out! Also, the energy lasted me for quite a long time! Seems to last a good 15 to 18 hours! I drank one just after midnight as I got to work tired, and was still plenty awake and full of energy at 6 PM (18 hours later) trying to get to sleep for the next work day!I found this odd, and figured it may have been a fluke. Considering I have never had such success with energy drinks, I had to perform some tests and compared days where I was not tired to days that I was tired and tried a No Fear drink. I have more energy when tired and using a No Fear than most days when I am fully awake! No Fear helps me go from very tired to being able to perform on one of my better days. I have to say, No Fear works great! No doubt about it - it tastes great, works great, and I am very happy to have found it!I am also very happy about the flavor. I would have to describe the flavor as a grapefruit-soda type flavor. My best description would be ""Squirt, but with actual grapefruit flavoring"" - because you don't taste much actual grapefruit in those other sodas. I love Squirt and grapefruit flavor, so No Fear's flavor was nothing less than AWESOME! And, I did not get that odd feeling in my belly that I tend to get with most other energy drinks!If you are wondering if No Fear is for you, I would recommend giving it a go. I normally have little to no benefit from energy drinks, and this one really worked! The flavor is great, and I did not experience a lack of energy when it wore off.

I have tried a bunch of different energy drinks from various companies and they are all pretty similar.  Lots of caffeine, Vit B, guarana, and similar ingredients.  There effectiveness depends on individuals' resistance to these stimulants.  I drink several cups of coffee and/or energy drinks a day so the effects are there but minimal compared to my wife who is smaller and will only have an occasional cup of tea or coffee.

Love this product.","5.0","Same Great Splenda","1316736000"
"nonpareil","B004OQ257M","Splenda is Splenda. That's easy. It works to create an illusion of sweetness. It can be most helpful if staying away from regular sugar is necessary. I was thin, too thin, for many years but gradually that changed. I still didn't have to count calories, just stay away from ingesting too much or too fatty food, but even that changed. Now I am analyzing my intake to eliminate the empty calories of cane sugar, corn syrup and the ilk, even the fructose of 100% fruit juices in favor of consuming the whole fruit.What's not easy is choosing whether to use an artificial sweetener. First of all, some people mistrust them, suspect them of being carcinogens etc. and ask whether the cure might be worse than the disease. Some of the other artificial sweeteners, which shall remain nameless, might bear investigation.But Splenda, which has only been available in the US for a dozen years, is sucralose plus dextrose and/or maltodextrin. Sucralose is actually derived from sugar but has no calories. The fillers add calories but not nearly as many as sugar. In addition, Splenda is heat-stable to 450F and does not add an artificial flavor to baked goods. However it is questionable whether the vitamins survive the heat of cooking.I find Splenda especially helpful in making desserts sugar-free when necessary, everything from puddings to pies to betties. This Splenda claims no calories, as do their other varieties. The actual caloric content of a single-serving, 1-gram packet [which is the size of the packet reviewed here] is 3.36 calories, which is less than a third of the calories of a single-serving, 2.8-gram packet of granulated sugar. FDA regulations allow foods to be labelled zero calories, ""if the food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving"". So that gets just a mite tricky. Regardless of FDA regs, I feel it is questionable to emblazon the packaging with a claim of ""No Calorie Sweetener"" when it actually does have them.Another packaging issue is the description ""Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)"". That made me think I would receive four packages of 0.7 oz. each which I could use in baking. But in fact there are 80 tiny foil packages suitable for use in individual cups of whatever, and the box states ""Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar."" No problem; you just need to be aware of what you will be getting as this stuff is really expensive.","5.0","B vitamin Splenda; discussion of caloric content","1318896000"

Statisticians used to think about 1 in 250 in the US could not tolerate wheat or gluten; today's estimate is more like 1 in 100 as physicians are starting to think outside the boxes into which they were trained, and are recognizing celiac disease and/or wheat allergy as the causes of persistent, hard-to-diagnose intestinal problems sometimes presenting as late as the sixth or seventh decade of life.There is one small glitch here, not sure how small a glitch. These bars are clearly labelled Gluten Free but there is also a statement, ""This product is produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts."" This statement does not mean that the product is MADE ON machinery on which wheat has been processed, and then reused to produce these. (Even if that were the case, thorough cleaning should eliminate gluten.) But after I ate the first bar, I had the typical celiac reaction and couldn't figure out what I had done wrong, as I had not ingested anything with gluten. And I confess I didn't suspect this product. I waited 5 days and ate another bar. Bingo. Within 24 hours I again had that unpleasant intestinal reaction, and it was preceded by the painful gut-rumbling and feeling of pressure that always happen when I ingest gluten.Now it happens that I have enough scientific training to know that neither of these incidents proves causal relationship between ingestion and reaction. But it certainly has my eyebrows raised, and should make you wonder, too. An accidental ingestion of gluten is not fatal to the celiac but long-term it produces damage and short-term it is a real nuisance. I'm not providing all the graphic details of what happens to me.So back to the goo issue. I had put the remaining bars in the fridge. Yes, the second one, several days later, was far less gooey. But still, a lot of goo remained on the wrapper. (Would it get there if not exposed to heat? Dunno.) To me, that brings up two problems. First, my basic use for snack bars is to keep from getting too hungry while driving, so they get kept in the vehicle. Any crumbs that fall are going to be nasty cuz they are sticky as opposed to dry-crumby which I can vacuum out easily. I did note that not too many crumbs fell.Second, sticky-wrapper disposal can be tricky and requires special attention. These are far more likely to attract vermin and again, stick to things and leave a residue I don't want. A sticky piece of wrapper just fell and disappeared as I was writing this review. It took some contortions and a flashlight to retrieve it but retrieve it I must or attract mice to my computer station. Speaking of mice, I now have to go get a wash cloth to get the stickiness from my fingers off the computer mouse.About the flavor, well, I was thinking that they might be ideal when I want a salt fix as opposed to a sugar fix. A close friend used to say that he thought I would eat hay if I thought it was good for me. Yes, I'm like that (snorts and whinnys). But these taste less like hay, more like cardboard.UPDATE, a year later: I stuck the box of these bars in the fridge and every once in a while when I have had the energy to tackle something difficult, I've eaten one. The jury is still out on the gluten issue - sometimes I've not had the gluten reaction. But I am even more firmly convinced that when a product is labelled ""Gluten Free"", that it should in fact be gluten free. Not just ""maybe"" like these. I mean really, it makes me wonder what part of allergic, etc. some people don't understand.The stickiness and hardness continue to be problems making enjoyment difficult but perhaps I've gotten used to that, expect it. Over time I have come to like the mildly sweet/salt taste better. Although I'm not totally thrilled with taste or texture, I have moved my rating from two stars to four.Thanks to the manufacturer for sending a whole box rather than just the single so often sent to Vine reviewers - I needed more in order to do a thorough review.","4.0","Are they gluten free?","1312588800"

A good friend of mine runs an upscale Lebanese restaurant in SO CAL, and I always wondered how he got his hummus so finely ground and creamy. I've done a good bit of traveling too, spending several weeks in Malaysia. Sounds odd, but there are AMAZING Arabic, Middle eastern, and Indian restaurants in Malaysia because of a friendly business market. This is the same type of hummus they make there.Out of the can, it needs to be mixed up and add olive oil to suit. You can also flavor it with roasted garlic - or whatever you want.

"nonpareil","B004R6BJ62","Apparently this is made from organic sesame seeds, nothing else added. It is smooth, not too runny at all, and sweet-tasting - which is to say, not bitter. Actually there is just the merest hint of bitter, just enough to remind you that you are, after all, tasting sesame. ""Butter, not bitter"". Ha.I proceeded to make a great batch of hummus using this. It lends just the right elusive note; a top-notch tahini is the only way to achieve that. A 16-ounce jar really isn't too much though it should be kept refrigerated as anything with high oil content and no preservatives is in danger of becoming rancid, especially in higher temperatures. Somehow the level of tahini in the jar is already lower than one batch of hummus should render it. Could it be that I am taste-testing it rather frequently? If you want to know, it does have a peanut butter consistency but of course a sesame taste.And finally, if you're worried about Amazon shipping a glass jar, you should know that some conscientious employee completely encased mine in bubble wrap, which was secured with tape. And there was packing material in the box. So barring a train wreck, this stood a great chance of getting to its destination intact. Which it did.","5.0","Delicious, creamy","1327708800"

Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.  Highly recommended.

By all appearances, no, but it had new packaging. Still, I ordered it and followed the package directions very carefully, maybe using only a slightly thinner cut of chop than pictured on the packaging.What came out of the oven was what we always had after using SnB: A chop with good flavor, but kind of mushy breading. The only place where the breading crisped up was around fat. But, considering that this is how SnB always worked for us before, I wasn't surprised.The spices used in the mix are the same as the past, and they flavor a chop well. The mushy breading isn't a big deal - what matters to us is how the food tastes. Boneless pork chops need a lot of help in the flavor department and Shake 'n Bake is one quick and cheap way to dress them up.

"barry","B004T3QMD8","I remember the Maxwell House International Coffees from about a decade ago and all I remember is the flavors sounded so great but the tase was always subdued and watery.  Luckily all that has changed with their updated International Lattes.  I was surprisingly happy with this product.  First time I made it was with water and though tasty I found it a little disappointing.  So I tried it with milk instead and everything changed.  What a delicious, frothy and luscious drink.  The good news is it in no way tastes artificial.  All the flavors, spices and coffee blend together perfectly.  The touch of cinnamon and pumpkin is delicious and in no way overpowering.  I found that with the milk the expected frothy foam with a latte was light, airy and added the needed final touch to this tasty latte.The flavor here of the pumpkin spice does lend itself more to holidays or chilly, cold days or nights but if it is your preferred flavor you may like it year round.  I only took off one star for it does take a little bit of configuration to decide how to make it to your liking.  But once you do, rest back, sip and enjoy this superb latte.  The days of the watered down International coffees is gone.  Highly recommend.","4.0","Perfect drink for a chilly day","1321315200"
"csm","B004T3QMD8","Admittedly, I was quite skeptical when ordering this item because, quite frankly, all of the other International Coffee products I've tried over the past 20 or so years, have literally made me ill.  Possibly because of the 5 pound sack of sugar in every drop but, lo and behold, Maxwell House bought them out and actually made this a great product!  I've had pumpkin lattes at both Starbuck's and Panera Bread and this product, no kidding, rivals them both!  It's honestly better than Starbucks and is almost equal to Panera's.  It's honestly that good and coming from me, you can believe that!  It has a very smooth, creamy top that seems to be from a latte machine (so, how do they do that?).  Just a nice, warm drink on a blustery fall day, not overly flavored with cloves either, just in case you're wondering about that spice.  Clove seems to cause problems with other products with pumpkin, leaving that weird, almost as if you've eaten licorice feeling in your mouth.  In addition, I'd like to know why it makes that popping sound when you put a teaspoon of the product into the water?)The one thing that Maxwell House hasn't solved is the problem they have with dissolving all of the product into the water.  That problem is still there and I suppose you could solve that with an electronic hot beverage mixer such as Mr. Coffee produces.  Also present is problem number 2 with International Coffees: you have to use at least 10 teaspoons to get the stuff to taste like anything.  They haven't changed that yet either.  I used 9 teaspoons in about 8 ounces, if that gives you some idea.  If you drink a mug of about 12-16 ounces, you'll only get about 5 cups out of this package.  Teacups, and I mean the kind that are used in England, you'll get about 20 cups from it.  But our large American mugs are going to require a great number of teaspoons to keep it from tasting like colored water.Other than that, I really like this product - so much so that I'm going out to buy more.  Something I've never done with International Coffee before.

"nonpareil","B004T3QMD8","I will start by listing the ingredients, which are not - at this point - given under the product description:(1) Sugar,(2) creamer (corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated  coconut oil, sodium caseinate (from milk), dipotassium phosphate, mono- and diglycerides, artificial flavor),(3) whey,(4) maltodextrin,(5) instant coffee,contains less than 2% of(6) cinnamon,(7) ginger,(8) natural and artificial flavor,(9) cellulose gum,(10) sodium citrate,(11) modified cornstarch,(12) silicon dioxide.I lined them up that way to make reading easier, especially so you can see the list that describes the creamer contents. For me this kind of hot drink is an occasional thing, especially for days when I've already had my normal unadulterated java and want something different. So I'm not terribly concerned about its health merits. You may want to note that this is a product of Kraft Foods.I found the taste pleasant, mostly creamer which I normally avoid, with the pick-me-up of coffee and flavor enjoyment of light pumpkin pie-type spices. On the second use a week later, I got the ratio of powder to water right. It takes a lot. The powder dissolves reasonably easily - some encouragement with the spoon was needed to break up a few clumps, and use of a milk frother would easily take care of that. The stuff forms its own convincing latte-type crema; a frother not needed there. Not bad, nice for the season and to offer guests, not mine for everyday but really enjoyable on a chilly afternoon when the coffee's all gone.","4.0","Nice, not particularly healthy","1320364800"
"Sadie","B004T3QMD8","This pumpkin spice latte has a mild pumpkin aroma and is lightly flavored.  It makes a nice cremora top, just like the hot lattes you get in an expensive coffee house.  I've had it as an evening drink to warm me up and as a morning pick me up.  It's good any time of the day.  I prefer my drinks to be sugar free, but Maxwell House doesn't make very many of its flavored coffees sugar free.  Even so, it's only 60 calories when made with hot water.

"Cher","B004T80BYE","I love this product but I won't be buying this any longer from here.  It has jumped in cost and it is just to much to spend now.  I (YOU) can make this all it is a pureed coconut blended into thick coconut butter, there are lots of recipes online and it is so easy, that the recipes are the same for the most part from site to site, unless you want to flavor with vanilla, mint, chocolate...I have noted a big increase in many items that I have bought or were on my wish list to buy, and I no longer use Amazon as my primary shopping site, which is sad because I really like their customer service.  But the raise in product cost, makes me rethink each item and look elsewhere before I purchase from them.At one time I bought everything on Amazon without bothering looking elsewhere, because they were the best, but now NOT so much.Look elsewhere too, you may find it cheaper, or make it your self for about $6-8 for 2 lbs depending on the cost of unsweetened coconut at your local store.","5.0","I love this product, BUT it has jumped in price over $6.","1372723200"

There are recipes too - it's quite nice in oatmeal and enhances smoothies quite well - something I've been trying to find for quite some time. The most aggravating thing, however, is that the product solidifies and you have to let it soak in how water for 5-10 minutes before you can use it EACH time. That can be annoying if you're in a hurry as I usually am most mornings. It isn't sweet so you won't be adding additional sugar to your recipes - just the flavor.

But the taste soon convinced me otherwise. These have a very good, very ginger-y and somewhat spicy flavor. I really enjoyed the little bits of ginger that are in each cookie, so that after the cookie is gone there's often a chewy bit of ginger that lingers. Yum. Also, they are smaller, like a silver dollar, and so grabbing a handful of these organic vegan gems does not bring on piles o' guilt.

"ephemeral","B004TPKAN4","These Ginger Snaps are made with organic flour and organic sugar, and are also vegan.  The ingredient list is pleasantly short and includes both candied and ground ginger.  I suspect the combination of the two types of ginger is why the cookies have such a strong bite.  These are not a mild cookie; they are very spicy and delicious.  Five cookies contain only 130 calories, and because of their kick, I only ate one or two cookies at a time.  This makes them a pretty low calorie snack.  My only real complaint about the cookies was the texture.  I like either a moist, soft cookie or one that is crisp and a little brittle.  Unfortunately, these were hard and chewy, almost as if they were stale.  I definitely wouldn't serve them to anyone who didn't have strong teeth.","4.0","Good Taste, Bad Texture","1322956800"

They are much more like old fashioned ginger snaps, as the name states.I've been a Newmans fan for many years, and like many of their products.

Once you've gotten the hang of it, you can get an al dente piece every time. What works for me is cooking it 3 minutes less than the recommended cooking time (give or take), draining the water and rinsing it quick and then kind of letting the hot moisture cook the rest through.Gonna get the spaghetti version next as we are trying to cut out all ""white"" pastas!","4.0","Brown rice you say?","1375056000"

But it's too much of a hassle to do it this way.This has the same unappetizing color of the sauce as the brown rice version - a pale tan with only a hint of orange at the bottom of the cup. Where was the vivid orange color of other boxed mac and cheese? I have to say that it wasn't very cheesy in taste either and it only made about a cup's worth of cooked macaroni. Not enough for an entree, but I guess adequate as a small side dish or snack.Verdict: Because of the boiling over problem and the lack of taste I don't think I will be buying this again.","1.0","Where's the flavor?","1360195200"

The taste was almost exactly that of regular Chips Ahoy!, which I really liked, but I have to admit the filling didn't really do it for me. I wanted it to be more dense and fudge-like, but instead it was really soft, like frosting, and took up too much of the cookie. The texture of the cookie was just a little too gooey in itself, I prefer something a little more grainy in a soft cookie.These weren't bad, but I guess I like the texture of a good cookie more than I like filling, so I would probably pass on these and get the standard Chips Ahoy! instead. I didn't hate them and I didn't love them. I can't see myself craving them.If you like frosting or soft filling in your baked goods, though, you might want to try these, because the taste was good and very reminiscent of a regular Chips Ahoy! cookie  I also liked the resealable package.","3.0","Familiar Taste, Definitely Gooey","1308700800"

"ephemeral","B004U49QU2","Nabisco's new Chips Ahoy! Chewy, Gooey, MegaFudge cookies are incredibly rich.  With a soft cookie that tastes more like a brownie, chocolate and white chocolate chips on the outside, and a soft and creamy chocolate filling, they definitely fulfill any chocolate craving you might have.  Of course, with so much chocolate jammed in, each little cookie (much smaller than you'd expect) has 75 calories in it.  So it is probably best to share a pack of these with friends, rather than give in to temptation and eat a big handful.While the taste is amazing, the cookies are ridiculously messy.  They literally fell apart in my hands when I picked them up out of the container.  The fudge filling is so soft and liquidy that it has the consistency of chocolate syrup rather than fudge sauce.  Using something so fluid as the center of the cookie seems like a way to guarantee they won't hold their shape.  Add to that the fact that the solid cookie part is extremely crumbly and the chocolate chips have a tendency to fall off, and you've got a recipe for disaster.  These cookies are without a doubt the messiest I've ever eaten.  I lost more to the floor and my shirt than I managed to get into my mouth.  I want a cookie that I can pack in my lunch or grab and snack on easily.  These certainly don't meet those needs.  Despite their amazing taste, they aren't worth the clean-up effort.","2.0","Delicious but Too Messy!","1309737600"
"Grace","B004U49QU2","I was excited to try these cookies, because I love Nabisco's oatmeal choco-chips softbaked cookies. The first bite and even the first cookie was okay, but I noticed that it was very sweet.  Also, it wasn't quite as melt-in-my-mouth as I had expected. Instead, these cookies are a little too crumbly (rather than soft like the softbaked ones). That means the cookies weren't very moist, despite the fudge center, which I don't think there was much of anyway. Though I love chocolate, the texture and ultra-sweetness kept me from wanting to return to the box again and again.

"Poogy","B004U49QU2","Hopefully you're not imagining that these cookies might be as good as home made.  Of course they're not.  They're  mass-produced, very sweet cookies that are fall-apart-in-your-hand soft and only slightly chewy, with a creamy--not fudgey--center. It's not as though you can't find really tasty, quality cookies in a package at the supermarket, but these are not first-class cookies even on the scale of what the big companies crank out by the millions. For example, Pepperidge Farm's soft-baked Captiva and Chocolate Chunk cookies are very similar in concept, but superior.The word ""fudge""--let alone ""Megafudge""--may conjure up Willie Wonka-like fantasies, or have you thinking you'll be biting into a big block of deep, dark chocolate fudge.  No, no, no. They're chocolate alright, but they look and sound a lot more chocolatey than they taste--not the kind you get from a bar of dark chocolate or premium chocolate ice cream, let alone fudge, but a disappointing, how-can-something-so-dark-brown-have-so-little-chocolate-flavor kind of taste. I can picture these being formulated in a lab by men in white coats, using jars of brown and white powders and syrups in test tubes. That kind of ""chocolate."" Those reviewers who squeal that these have a rich chocolate flavor sadly don't know what they're missing.  They're also smaller than I expected; maybe two inches in diameter, not the sort of three- or four-inch disks you'd likely find in a bakery (or the Pepperidge Farm varieties), or would make at home; you'll need two or three just to feel like you've eaten something.If you put some in your child's lunch, will he or she like them?  Why not--he or she will likely be enjoying the sugar rush for an hour before falling asleep.  If you sit down in front of the TV with them can you eat ten of them before you know it?  Sure.

"Muttley","B004VITI0K","This item is a regular member of my monthly subscribe and save order, through which I save an additional up to 20% over already decent price tag. It has many uses in the household ranging from a coffee mate substitute to an essential baking ingredient but the main function at our household is as an emergency solution when milk or coffee creamer runs out.It can be used to directly substitute drinking milk and the ratios on how to re-hydrate are given clearly at the back of the bag. Basically you add water to 1/3 cup of this to make an 8 ounces glass of milk. Should you use all of the bag (32 servings) to make milk, you are supposed to end up with 2 gallons of fat free milk. Considering the cost of a bag being $8.61 (after discounts) in my recent order, a gallon makes $4.3 which is slightly more expensive than grocery milk but still in the ballpark. (I buy it around $3.2/gallon while some other stores sell it for up to $4/gallon in where I live.)The key advantage of using this item is that apart from Vitamin D and A there is absolutely nothing added into this. All you buy is a non fat dry milk powder with no fillers, additives, preservatives and any other nasty stuff. So I use it safely while making cookies for my kids. Besides that I enjoy it as a coffee creamer, but I have to say that half-half is a better tasting option yet this one is fat free and so way healthier if you can get use to the difference in taste. (most other coffee creamers on the market have many nasty stuff in it )An other advantage is that it comes in a resealable self-standing bag so saving the remaining is not a big issue if you can keep it in cool-dry place .In the end, I love this product for the convenience it offers at a decent price tag and sky is your limit to find uses for this. Having no nasty ingredients is another selling point for us too. I will keep ordering it","5.0","instant solution to routine problems...","1404086400"

"AlisonA","B004VLVBVG","Ordered these by accident instead of rolled oats that I used for homemade granola. Rather than wasting time and money to send them back, I decided to find ways to incorporate them into our meal plans.First I made a batch of granola with nothing but steel-cut oats instead of rolled oats. Results = way too crunchy and dense for our liking. The next batch was half rolled oats and half steel-cut; much better but still too crunch and too many little bits in the bottom of the cereal bowl. The third batch was 5 parts rolled to 1 part steel-cut (recipe calls for six cups). Perfect! We love the additional crunch that these add, especially since I recently seem to be having trouble with eating nuts.Second, I decided to try grinding these in the dry-grains blender of my Vitamix to make oat flour. Voila! Believe it or not, these made a much finer flour than the rolled oats, probably because the dry-grains blade works better on harder items rather than soft. The oat flour was very smooth and consistent, and tasted great in the baked goods, too.I probably won't buy a four-pack of steel-cut oats again for awhile, but when I do order more, I'll be happy to get them from Bob's Red Mill since the quality is always good.","4.0","Oops...","1390867200"

"Muttley","B004VLVI1O","I like Bob's red mill as a company since they offer a wide range of natural alternatives for bakery ingredients. But I used to like them more before I discovered that local groceries supply similar quality items at a fraction of their prices. The selling point for this product is that it is unbleached (no toxic chemicals are used to make flour look whiter) and unbromated (does not have bromate that is used to make puffier and well raised breads, cakes but is also a proven carcinogen) Not many flours in the groceries have both unbleached and unbromated labels on them. So as a home bread maker, I tried these flours a couple of times last year.Although they were slightly more pricey compared to similar flours in the groceries, I bought them due to the good company reputation. However they were offered at $16 as of summer 2013 and there was a potential to save even more with subscribe and save. Soon after I realized Wegmans (labeled unbleached-unbromated) and Target (does not say unbromated but bromate is not listed in ingredients and I confirmed it by writing to the customer service) have unbleached flour at less than  $0.45/lb (less than $9 per 20 lbs)  so I gave up Bob's red mill. Now I see the price climbed up to $32 which is a total rip off.Taste and ingredient wise, including protein level, there was no difference at all. The only difference is that these are offered in fancier packaging with a handsome old boy photo of Bob on them . So if you feel this is worth the 4 times price difference then go for it, if not then check for the local alternatives by simply looking at the ingredients and I am sure you will find similar items at much lower prices.","3.0","Bob's old boy photo and a shiny packaging is not worth the hefty price","1400371200"

"Muttley","B004VLVN7S","When it comes to buying corn products, Organic options are my only choices since over 95% of all corn grown in the US is GMO. Is GMO products real evil or not is a total different debate. However, I just feel safer when avoiding them. I like Bob's red mill as a company which offers a wide range of products. I have tried a couple of them and although they are not always the most affordable options they are mostly of good quality and avoid nasty ingredients that are found in some other counterparts sold in stores.I bought this to make cookies and I tried a couple of recipes, the one on the back of the pack is a good one  too (but you can limit the butter a little to make your cookies healthier). You can also use it to improve the texture of various foods. It is tasty plus not very fine grind so you can feel the rough texture which is good for me.The only concern so far is the difficulty to store it once opened. I bought it as 4 pack, opened one of them and used it a couple of times in a month but then, did not use it for a while. When I came back to use it again, I found it got molded all over so I had to discard it. Mostly grain products are quite easy to store but this one proved to be an exemption so it is good to keep this in mind before ordering. (may be using a dessicant in a sealed container could help.)Finally, as I said before, I can not stand behind the price tags of most of the Bob's red mill products that is why I often choose cheaper alternatives, provided that they meet my quality criterias. However, a $13.16 price tag with the option of saving up to 20% through subscribe and save program plus prime membership is a fair one. So I am happy with the purchase..","5.0","makes good cookies but should be consumed fast after opening","1403136000"

"csm","B004YV80O4","In our house, I've been barred from EVER buying Hamburger Helper.  I suppose that's what happens when you cook from scratch for a bunch of boys nightly!  So, when I mentioned that we were going to try this, the number of moans and groans almost outweighed the sound of the hamburger cooking in the skillet.  But, were we ever in for a surprise.  This stuff is awesome!  It actually includes a large packet of smooth Velveeta cheese to mix in with the entree and just that one element really makes it go over the top in taste.  Mind you, if you'd like to save the calories from the cheese packet, the entree tastes great without it.My only complaints are: 1), it's a bit salty.  This is particularly heightened after adding that packet of cheese.  It's not over the top like some soups can be, but it's definitely a negative.  If you're on a salt-controlled diet, this might be an issue. 2). The actual serving size of the package is small.  And I mean, VERY small.  If you have a family of 3, then each individual would get one serving.  Any larger than that, then you're in trouble unless you have VERY young children.  If you have a hungry husband and sons, you'll wind up buying 3 boxes to actually make enough to fill them up.  My suggestion: add a salad with meat, along with a vegetable and some healthy bread and that helps considerably.  In addition, add something like a can of diced tomatoes to this dish and use ground turkey or chicken to make it healthier.  Milk to drink always helps too.  There is enough sauce to add an additional 1/2 pound of meat to the dish, along with the tomatoes, and the cheese sauce can cook a bit longer in the pan to make it more ""runny"" to infuse with the additional ingredients.So, this is definitely a ""keeper"" in this house.  I about fell off my chair when I heard a ""Yum!""  But, Velveeta has been creating ""Yums"" for years and I am not surprised that this dish is in keeping with their history. Highly recommend!","5.0","Fabulous product - Improvement over Hamburger Helper!","1311724800"
"jpr","B004YV80O4","This is a pretty good product, as long as you know what to expect.  Some of the reviews seem overly critical, considering that the product price and description are right in line with most other comparable items.  It looked fine prepared, and I'll post a couple photos to illustrate.  All of my family members liked it.  They didn't jump up and down for joy and declare that it was pure tastebud-heaven in a box, but they did have seconds.First, some background.  I find that one of the more challenging aspects of preparing meals for a family on a daily basis is often just figuring out what to have.  Some people are really organized and plan their menus for the week in advance.  They buy the exact ingredients they'll need for the next few days and always know what they're going to have.  I'm not that way. There have even been times when I've had something in mind and started to cook it, and then changed what I was making mid-stream, while still using the items I'd already started to prepare as part of the new dish.Maybe it comes from watching too many TV shows like MacGyver over the years, or perhaps I'm just weird, but the bottom line is I'm not that organized when it comes to everyday meals.  Aside from the staples, I usually look for good prices and buy what's on sale.  I also sometimes feel like having something different depending on the weather or people's moods or schedules.  This keeps things interesting and it's a system that works for us, but it's not perfect.The obvious downside of such a method is that there are days when I walk into the kitchen and have no idea what to make.  I look in the fridge and freezer and nothing comes to mind.  The old standby dishes can only be made so often, ordering out would be admitting defeat, and I probably don't have some of the ingredients I'd need to make something new from one of the cookbooks on the shelf.  Those tend to be the days I turn to my third-string emergency backup: boxed dinners.Most boxed dinners tend to consist of some kind of noodles or rice with various flavored sauces, sometimes dehydrated vegetables, and may or may not call for the addition of chicken, tuna, or ground beef.  This one fits the pattern (just add chicken), but adds a bit of a twist by using Orzo (rice-shaped pasta) and including a pouch of Velveeta cheese sauce and a small packet of freeze-dried broccoli bits for variety.I prepared this almost according to package directions but with a small variation.  I cut up some boneless skinless chicken breast into strips, letting them sit in a little oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt & pepper, and herbs for a while, and then fried them.  I only added the extra ingredients to the chicken because I had used more than the box called for.  Portion size looked like it would be a bit small for the family otherwise, but I was concerned that using more chicken would make the dish too bland since the seasoning packet was only intended to be used for about 1lb.  Other than that, it was made as specified, and with a crumb topping as the box suggested.Overall, it was about what I had expected from an inexpensive box dinner, and just a bit different from the typical chicken helper/hamburger helper/tuna helper.  Sometimes that's just what's needed to kickstart dinner on one of those nights when I'm out of ideas.  I'll probably buy more if I notice them on sale.","4.0","Actually Pretty Good For What It Is!","1316995200"
"Pamela","B004YV80O4","You can think of the Velveeta Cheesy Skillets as a higher-end version of Hamburger Helper.  The ingredients are a bit more imaginative and the flavor is definitely better.  The chicken and broccoli skillet was definitely tasty and very easy to make.I particularly like that it includes orzo pasta instead of the usual macaroni or shells that you so often see in boxed one-skillet meals.  The flavoring is good and the signature Velveeta cheese adds a delicious creaminess to the dish.My only complaint is that the broccoli really isn't great.  It's freeze-dried, which makes sense considering that this is a non-refrigerated kit, but the pieces are extremely tiny and the taste isn't all that great.  I ended up stirring in some steamed fresh broccoli, and that made the dish taste a LOT better.","4.0","Tasty & quick!","1318032000"

So I'll probably wind up getting some more of this. It is very cheesy tasting, not too cheesy for me, but the garlic and onion flavoring did turn out kind of extreme for my taste buds. I'll try a different version than the Cheeseburger Mac next time out.","3.0","Mixed reviews in this household.","1322956800"

But, I saw this available through Vine, and I decided to try it because I travel a lot and figured it may be something my family can make without too much trouble when I am away. I have to say, it was pretty good.Two of my kids were home the night I made dinner and the 10 year old and 17 year old really liked this. I did not use the broccoli included in the package, and instead sprinkled some fresh broccoli on top. The packaged broccoli looked awful; it was dried, crumbly, and small. It barely resembled broccoli and I was afraid it would just taste nasty and ruin the dish. I also added cold grilled chicken breast slices and stirred them in when the dish was hot so the cheese and pasta warmed up the chicken pieces just enough.The cheese is processed, but overall it didn't taste like it. And, the sodium content was not nearly as high as I expected. My 10 year old LOVED the meal and wants it again.

"319","B0051COPFI","Ever since I introduced fruits to my 8 month old daughter, she almost always refuses her vegetables. This  Baby Gourmet food is the perfect solution. I received the Juicy Pear and Garden Greens flavor which consists of Organic Pear, Organic Broccoli, Organic Spinach, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate. I tasted it before I gave it to my baby and it's surprising tasty and kind of sweet, I would have never guessed that it had spinach or broccoli in it. She ate it without a fuss and I was so relieved. She also suffers from a milk protein allergy and this baby food is dairy free. It's also free of egg, lactose, gluten and nuts. The plastic packaging is BPA-Free and very handy to throw in my purse or diaper bag, as opposed to the glass jars I usually carry around. I'm so impressed with this baby food and I highly recommend it to others.","5.0","My picky baby loves this","1334966400"

"eyecore","B0051COPFI","This little packet (okay, it's not really a ""little packet;"" at 4.5 ounces, it's actually fairly hefty) is pretty much exactly what nature intended -  and parents that actually care about quality have been searching for.  With organic ingredients that you know exactly what they are, rather than some cocktail of chemicals, the first impression is a good one.  Each pouch has a screw-top lid that the kid can suck the contents out of...and reseal if it's not finished.  May not be the most sanitary of practices, but as long as you make sure it doesn't sit around for days before reusing, it won't be a problem.Then there's the flavor.  Yep, I had to try it.  It basically tastes like an ""earthy"" apple sauce made with pears.  Which is exactly what it should taste like, since it's made from pears and spinach (among a couple others.)  And the texture is very similar to apple sauce as well, except it's much creamier...none of the ""grit"" feeling.I'd recommend this for snacking, a meal unto itself, or mixing with other foods (oatmeal flakes) to make them more appetizing to your baby.

These are great to keep in the diaper bag--just remember a spoon to squirt it onto! But, though they are convenient, they do create more waste than recyclable glass or plastic containers---which is why they aren't the mainstay of my baby's diet and really only go in the diaper bag (so I don't feel like I have to bring home containers to recycle).

"Maggie","B0051COPFI","OK, here are some things that I like about this product.1)  It is organic!  Yay!2)  There is a mix of fruits and vegetables.  You cannot find these combo's in the supermarket.3)  It can easily be tossed into a diaper bag without worry that it will break.4)  No need for a spoon!  Just squirt the food into the baby's mouth and they are happy!Here is what I don't particularly care for.1) The packaging is kind of difficult for a baby to squeeze.  With the way that the opening is placed, the baby normally tries to squeeze the sides together which doesn't make the baby food come out that easily.2)  The opening is very small.  In my opinion, the opening should be the size of a bottle nipple so that a baby feels comfortable sucking on the spout.I really like this food and will buy more.

As Dr. Oz has said, vegetables are bitter and things in the wild that are poisonous are bitter, so rejecting bitter things is a safety thing ingrained in our DNA.  Much to our surprise, they really liked it.  It's nice to have vegetables they really like.The pouches are new to us.  You can heat the food by placing the pouch in hot water, or you can transfer it to a bowl and use the microwave, being careful to check for hot spots.  Room temp was fine for our guys.

"csm","B0051SU0OW","I know a lot of people have reviewed this item and have said that this thing is about mediocre at best. That's a pretty accurate assessment.  However, they have improved these over the past year or two so they're actually pretty good to have around.  I do think Keurig's is now better than this version, however.You're not really saving on coffee by using this thing - I normally use 3 scoops of coffee to make two 12 ounce mugs of coffee every morning in my Kitchenaid coffee pot.  This eko-cup uses 2 scoops to make one very weak 12 ounce mug.  It's all about the speed in the Keurig, not taste, and you have to use more coffee to get the same taste.  If the coffee doesn't brew, then the beans are not used properly and you're just going to get a weaker cup of coffee.  Also, the most this cup can take is 2 scoops so unless you make a smaller cup, or say, 8 ounces, your coffee will be weak.All that to say, buy one of these to use in a pinch if you run out of the K-cups - the Keurig is just expensive to use all the way around, but these refillable cups haven't solved that problem, unfortunately.","3.0","Better than Keurig's own version, but still expensive","1340150400"

"jeninmaine","B0051SU0OW","When I received my Keurig for xmas I got myself one of their reusable basket filters, the kind that comes with a plastic assembly that the filter sits inside of.  At first I thought it was great but over time I found it fiddly to use, prone to being messy, and probably the most vexing was that it wasn't easy to make multiple cups for company.  The outer sleeve gets very hot and was difficult to handle without letting it cool first.  I also hated having to remove part of the machine so that it would fit.I finally decided to try something new and saw the Ekobrew here on Amazon so I bought the four-pack as it was the best deal.  From the very first time I used one it clearly set itself head and shoulders above the Keurig filter.  It's just one piece, it fits into the machine without having to remove the K-cup holding apparatus, it sits right in there and all you have to do is line up the bottom or the top so that the puncturing needle fits into one of the recesses on the bottom of the Ekobrew.Cleanup is so easy - the plastic cools off quickly and it's easy to tap out the grounds and give it a quick hand wash or rinse and then it's ready to use again.  I like having more than one as I can make multiple cups of coffee at a time.  They take up very little room (again as opposed to the Keurig filter) and open and close easily.  The only thing that might not be durable in the long haul is the plastic hinge, but even if that broke you could still close the lid securely and use it.I really like these filters so much better than the Keurig, and have recommended them to all of my friends who have a machine.","5.0","LOVE these!","1371513600"

If you don't like grounds in your coffee don't buy this product.Thank you.Update have owned the Eko Brew for a little over a month and I am getting the same results with the ground at the bottom of the cup, maybe if they made tiny paper filters to absorb the ground that would help.","2.0","Not so great","1346284800"

I can use ground coffee or get whole bean and grind it myself to make the perfect cup at much cheaper than a normal K cup. It's fresher, more flavorful, and of course there is the benefit of less waste in the trash can.Construction of the Ekobrew is very sturdy. It seals up well. Another nice thing about it is if I take it out of the Keurig after being dnoe using it, It doesn't drip out water, so it's safe to put it on my table because it's flat on the bottom and always stays dry.This review is for the BROWN colored one.

"AlisonA","B0051WV5K6","I've made water kefir before... until my my grains went down the drain in a case of mistaken identity. DH thought he was helping me by cleaning out the fridge while I was away, and didn't know that I'd put the grains there on inactive status till I returned; he thought he needed to save me from something unsavory that appeared to be reproducing, lol. Well, at least they had been a gift so they hadn't cost me anything.ANYWAY, I finally got around to ordering a new batch here on Amazon. They arrived in a very small packet, and I immediately put them to work following the included recipe. This recipe was different from others in that it didn't require boiling the water and sugar to make a syrup. Instead, the seller suggested putting the grains in a jar, putting the sugar on top of them, pouring in the water, and stirring until the sugar dissolved. Honestly, this worked EXACTLY the same as if I had boiled the sugar syrup. I was thrilled to eliminate that step since the time for boiling and then waiting for the syrup to cool off was always a major deterrent for me as someone who works full-time and needs to find all the shortcuts possible for making healthy, fresh, and organic foods and drinks.Also, after just three batches of kefir water, the grains have almost doubled.

Now that they have settled into their new environment, the grains have almost doubled in volume and are exceptionally vigorous (they put my ginger beer plant to shame!).  I particularly recommend combining the water kefir 50:50 with preservative free fruit juice (I have enjoyed grape or cherry) and a bit of lemon juice and put in a pop bottle at room temperature for a few days to become fizzy.","5.0","Really vigorous grains","1354838400"

The Portabello kit I previously was blooming within a few days and I got a lot of mushrooms out of it with very minimal effort, so I really don't know what went wrong here.I am giving it two stars because the company offers a guarantee and will ship you a new kit if it doesn't work, but still, it would be a big disappointment for children to get excited about this project only to have nothing happen. If you just wanted to eat some Oyster mushrooms, I'd save your money and just buy them at the grocery store.","2.0","Didn't Work","1373846400"
"Kiwi","B0052Z92WA","I had seen these mushroom growing boxes advertised online but had never tried one before now. I jumped at the chance to try it in my own home. It has been so much fun to watch the mushrooms grow from a solid brick. The instructions are easy and I moistened the brick several times a day.By day three I had little mushroom heads popping through and by day 7, they were bursting out all over. Just gorgeous. I have a few more days before harvesting, but I highly recommend this experiment to anyone who loves nature and growing edible vegetables and fruits. I can't imagine how exciting this would be for a child, but being a big kid, I'm loving it. I like the company as well and will highly recommend this product to many.

"Pamela","B0052Z92WA","This thing is super, super cool.  The instructions are very clear, and within three days of starting the kit, we had amazingly weird-looking mushroom sprouts popping out of the box.  By nine days, the oyster mushrooms were very large and ready to harvest!  We ended up taking our box from where we live (Oregon) to San Diego on a family trip, and we discovered that the kit seems to grow much better in a more humid climate.  In our house in Oregon, where it had been raining off and on and with temperatures in our house staying in the low 70s, the mushrooms grew very quickly.  In San Diego, where it was much dryer and where the house got into the 80s during the day, the growth slowed quite a bit, and it actually took a very long time for a few mushrooms to come out during the second growth cycle.So if you live somewhere damp, you should definitely get this.  It is amazing to watch the mushrooms grow, and for us, they grew so quickly you could almost see them getting bigger.  If you're in a drier climate, I'd suggest misting the mushrooms with water a little more often to help them along, particularly if your house gets warm.","5.0","Fun and edible!","1376611200"

"chaos","B0054TWQMM","I have been using black chia seeds for a while now. I add them to my food for the nutritional value. Chia seeds are high in Omega-3, protein and fiber. There really is not much difference between black chia seeds and white chia seeds (besides the color).I use chia seeds now instead of flax seeds because they don't alter the food as much as the ground flax seeds do. I like that chia seeds can be used whole. They don't need to be ground to release their nutritional benefits. You can add chia seeds to almost anything you eat. They can even be added to foods that are baked or cooked. They add no flavor.The one thing I don't like about chia seeds, especially black chia seeds, is that they can get stuck in your teeth. Not a pretty site.Chia seeds do not need to be refrigerated. These chia seeds are a product of Mexico and they are labeled USDA organic.","4.0","cha-cha-cha-chia","1327449600"
"Poogy","B0054TWQMM","The health benefits of chia seed has been widely reported.  For example, like flax seed, they contain omega-3 fatty acids,and unlike flax, there's no need to grind them to break the outer coat.  (It's also said the form of omega-3 found in both flax and chia isn't as valuable as that found in fish oil, but you may not car if you're a vegetarian, and for that matter, it doesn't have to be the best possible form of the nutrient for it to be worth eating.) Chia is also a good source of soluble fiber, which is known to promote digestive health and lower cholesterol, like the fiber in oatmeal, apples, and psyllium (the last of which, the main ingredient in Metamucil, isn't the kind of thing most people enjoy consuming.) Mixed with water, chia turns into a gel, but you don't have to mix it with water to receive the benefits--it will turn into a gel in your digestive tract regardless of how you eat it.I use them in smoothies, in yoghurt, in baked goods, and sprinkled on salads. They don't have much flavor, but then again, they also don't get in the way of the flavor what you're eating them with.  A simple way to boost your intake of soluble fiber and omega-3.  This particular brand is organic, which I appreciate.  Otherwise, chia is chia.","5.0","Nutritious and Versatile","1324252800"

But just for today, I decided to go ahead and actually make them the way they're supposed to be made.  I have to say, it's a nice, refreshing flavor.  Limeade is great, but that subtle kick of mint does make it just a bit more refreshing.  And since I made them sans alcohol, as instructed on the package, I poured some for my 4 and 6-year-old kids.  I thought the mint might throw them off, but they both remarked right away that they loved it.  So go ahead, order it and make a pitcher - it won't go to waste.And on another note, I'm still planning to do a little experimenting to see if I can make a grown up version of this in a blender with some water, ice, and light rum.","5.0","Light and luscious","1316649600"
"Tori","B005A1LINC","I am a mojito junkie. Give me a minty mojito on a hot summer day (make sure you're not skimpy on that booze!) and I will be in heaven. No joke.I originally saw these Crystal Light Mocktails in my grocery store a month or two ago. While intrigued, I chose not to purchase this product due to my sensitivity towards artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose. Both tend to give me headaches and nausea, depending on the amount consumed. My reaction got so bad that I actually had to give up gum at one point (but I am a gum-aholic, so...). Lucky me food manufacturers put those things in EVERYTHING.But I digress. When I saw this was being offered to Vine members, I knew I had to give it a shot--sensitivity be damned.Two days ago, I received my Mojito Mocktail in the mail. I opened a package, poured it into a huge pitcher, and filled it with plenty of water. Upon taste testing, I was semi-impressed. Like another reviewer said, this was like a watered down lime drink. The mint is there, but it's not very strong. I knew it was missing something--and not the booze. Luckily, I had club soda in my fridge, so I poured half of a mini bottle into my glass. Instantly, my drink became a lot more appealing, and hence why the star rating is a 4.By itself, this mocktail is okay (probably 3 stars). With the addition of club soda, it becomes a lot tastier (4 stars).And while I know that this is supposed to be a mocktail, I cannot help but wonder if this would be good with some alcohol in it. I'd test it, but I got my nausea/headache from the aspartame and sucralose after a few hearty gulps which means no more for me.Would I recommend it? Only if you do not have an artificial sugar sensitivity. My family seems to enjoy it though, so while I might not purchase this for myself, I probably would for them... or someone who does not drink alcohol, but enjoys the taste of mojitos.","4.0","I'd give this a 3.5 star rating","1316649600"

"jpr","B005BPVB84","It seems like another new type of nutrition bar, energy bar, or diet bar pops up every week.  I can't even count the number of brands, let alone varieties.  A lot of them are loaded with sugar, and in many cases you might be better off just eating an apple or a banana and a handful of nuts, but they are really convenient to have around.  They keep for a long time, have interesting and varied flavors, and are certainly much better for you than most any candy bar.To compete in such a crowded market, these products need some sort of differentiator to set them apart from the crowd.  In the case of ""Eat. Think. Smile."" from Apure foods (a Colorado subsidiary of Hershey's) it's the Cocoa Lavado, which they claim has much higher levels of antioxidants in comparison to common Dutch processed cocoa.  Such flavonoids might be good for your heart and circulatory system and could potentially even lower cancer risk a tiny bit.There have been at least a couple of studies indicating there may well be health benefits to lavado ""washed"" cocoa, including one last year from Pennsylvania State University that showed the higher levels of polyphenols in this type of cocoa appear to help block carbohydrates and fats, potentially helping manage weight.I was curious how much of this cocoa is in each bar, in comparison to how much would be needed for any health benefits to be fully realized.  A Hershey study cited by Eat. Think. Smile. seemed to indicate that consuming 22g of natural cocoa was found to cause a measureable improvement in blood vessel health, but I couldn't easily find how many grams of cocoa these bars actually contain.  I'll have to assume for now that they contain at least enough to provide some potential benefit.So, is it enough?  I had to also evaluate the taste, price, and other factors to help find out.At over a dollar per bar, these certainly aren't cheap, but also not out of line with other nutrition bars on the market.  I don't know how much it costs to make one of these or a PowerBar or Cliff Bar, etc, but I suspect they must be rather profitable, as evidenced by the crowded market, and yet still fairly steady prices.  I must be in the wrong line of work.As for ingredients and nutrition, these certainly aren't for the allergy-prone, as they contain nuts, milk, wheat, corn, and eggs.  As long as that's not a problem, they seem reasonably balanced from a nutritional perspective with mostly natural ingredients, including the cocoa, and without a bunch of extra vitamins artificially crammed in for show.  They have 200 calories, 4g protein, and 6g of fiber, much of it from chicory root extract (for comparison Fiber One bars, which are a little smaller, have about 140 calories, 2g protein, and 9g of fiber).I found the Dark Cherry flavor nutrition bars to have a nice flavor, fairly sweet, but not overpoweringly so, with a somewhat light and vaguely cakelike texture (at least in comparison to heavy protein and sports nutrition bars).  The cherry bits, nuts, and oats seemed well balanced without overpowering the cocoa flavor, and as nutrition bars go, these tasted pretty good.Would I buy more?  Probably, if they go on sale.  I do like them better than some other bars, and I also like the idea of the natural, minimally processed cocoa, but I still think the whole product category is overpriced so I tend to either look for good deals, or I find alternate snacks (for example the aforementioned fresh fruit and nuts).  It's hard to beat the convenience of bars you can just drop in a backpack or desk or locker for when you need them though, and these seem as good as most and better than many.","4.0","Enough to stand out among a sea of nutrition bars?","1329868800"

"eyecore","B005BPVE3G","I like chewy granola bars.  In fact, theCascadian Farm Organic Chewy Granola Barare the best I've had in terms of flavor and texture.  Next up, theNature Valley Crunchy Granola Barshave a great flavor, but they're crunchy.  Good, but crunchy.These ""Eat.  Think.  Smile."" granola bars, texture-wise, could be considered the unfortunate offspring of the above chewy and crunchy goodness.  Mine were ""mostly crunchy"" (but not dry like those that are advertised as crunchy) but when a small enough piece was in my mouth, it softened up enough to not be crunch.  If you take the entire bar and fold it in half, it will break, not bend.So, kill one star for the ""Chewy"" not living up to its name here.And the other star goes away for a variety of reasons:  ""mixed berry"" is misleading, unless you consider juice a berry.  The only actual berry in here is cherry, and while it does provide a burst of sweetness, it doesn't taste much like a cherry.  And the cocoa powder they use seems to be more for health benefits (anti-oxidants) and coloring than for flavor, because these neither smell like nor taste any like cocoa/chocolate.All in all, I wouldn't really recommend these unless you're don't mind the texture, and can tolerate a granola bar not tasting like granola, chocolate or ""berries"" (cherries) that they're advertised as.","3.0","OK flavor, weird texture...","1330128000"

"barry","B005CT9OYM","I always eat healthy and boneless skinless chicken breat is my favorite meat.  I can eat it simply spiced with fresh vegetables and a big salad.  But I always look for new ways to brighten up the taste without adding fat, salt and calories.  This new series of Knorr Roasters roasting bags are great.  The garlic parmesan and italian herb blend is particularly tasty.  It is so easy to use.  I cook chicken anyways and I just put 2 pounds of the boneless skinless chicken in the bag and follow the simple directions.  The end result is superb.  The chicken gets a gentle coating of the spices and there is a great deal of juices left over.  So I still add the fresh veggies but now have a sauce to brighten the taste of them as well.  For anyone looking for a new and delicious way to cook chicken  this is it.  No fat, artificial flavors and minimal sodium and calories while your tastebuds will get a definite treat.  Highly recommend.","5.0","Excellent new healthy way to cook chicken","1363305600"
"chaos","B005CT9OYM","I have used oven bags for cooking for many years and I love the results. This was the first time that I used a bag where the directions did not have you cut slits in the bag. I was worried that the bag would explode, but, fortunately it did not. The flavor of the seasoning mix was good, but not great. It was very garlicky, but I was expecting that.

The problem was that it was also really pretty bland.  Not bad but not interesting.  Instructions say to use two pounds of chicken either boneless or with bone per packet.  Two pounds of chicken with bones is a lot less meat than 2 pounds of boneless chicken.  I used about three pounds of drumsticks.  Spooned the sauce on the chicken and all over my rice.  Just not much to it.  Whole family was just kinda like ""ehh...""  I would advise folks to take a look at the ingredients list because there is a LOT of stuff that is really hard to pronounce let alone know what they are.  Knorr is a Unilever brand.

The top has the roasting bag, along with a light blue closure taped to it. The bottom has the seasoning mix. It doesn't look like a lot of seasoning, but it was plenty for the 2 1/2lb bag of chicken I used. I put the chicken in, sealed it, shook it, put it in a baking dish, and in the oven. About 30 min later, cut the top off and dipped  it out for supper since my husband was standing over the stove, wanting to know what smelled so good. Afterwards, I poured the rest into a Rubbermaid container, tossed the bag, and put the baking dish away. Done.Good stuff!","5.0","Easy and delicious!","1361664000"

"Bill","B005HEEFN2","Best pizza crust I can recall eating, and made at home! This dough rises and proofs up very well, easy to work with, soft & pliable.After mixing & proofing. I rolled it out, mostly by hand, topped with a homemade basil pesto [walnuts, garlic, parmesan, & EVVO]. Thin sliced tomatoes, red onions, pepperoni, fennel seed, half 6 cheese italian, & half goat cheese.Put a large size tile on the barbecue grill set to high, cooked for about 10 mins. Have to say, this was the best pizza crust I can recall eating and that's saying a lot!This was the first time using a barbecue grill to cook pizza. I presume this has a similar high heat pizza oven effect. So I will be doing pizza's in the barbecue grill now. The crust had a yummo crunch to it, to me the crust had almost a kettle chip like crunch to it.If I was to buy this item again, I would get/recommend buying the 4 bag deal, as the ship charge is the same as the two bag ship charge. This flour goes quick, as two cups of flour is approx. half of a 2.2 lb. bag.A 2 cup flour batch makes 4 medium size pizza balls. So you get approx. 8-9 reg. size pizza's out of one 2.2lb. bag.They sell this in a blue bag also, which looks like the same ""00"" flour, but not sure on this.

"Bud","B005IW4WEA","I'll get the ugly out of the way first.  The 11 oz bag is rather small -- not much bigger than your hand.  It contains 11 1oz servings of 1/3 cup.  I could easily eat 1/2 a bag without really trying.  They are not really clusters as pictured, but crumbs like in a typical oat cereal.I don't have any special dietary requirements, but I do mind pretty carefully what I eat, so here's my review:Very tasty.  Much better than expected.  A little on the sweet side.  The cinnamon was not overpowering.  Very versatile as well.  You can eat it loose as a snack (although a bit messy the further down you get in the bag since there are few ""clusters"" -- more crumbs and dust).  You can also put it over yogurt or other dessert, or eat it with milk as a cereal.Nutritionally, I really like that it has whole grains which give it a nice texture, but not too hard to chew.  Refreshing compared to all those heavily processed foods out there.  Here are the Nutrition Facts per 1/3 cup 1oz serving:Calories: 130Calories from Fat: 30Total Fat: 3.5gSaturated/Trans: 0gCholesterol: 0mgSodium: 20mgTotal Carb: 22gDietary Fiber: 5gSugars: 6gProtein: 3gBasically trace/minimal amounts of vitamins/everything elseMy ""reference"" cereal is GoLean Original which is 140 calories for 1 cup serving.  Compared to this, the GoLean has 13g of protein and 10g of fiber while being 3x the volume.  The Kind clusters do have more whole grains 16g (versus 8g) and 720mg of omega-3, so it is still fairly healthy, especially if considered a snack in its small portion size.The list price of over $100 is a joke.  Amazon's price in the mid-teens is fair, but it would be a lot more palatable if it was cheaper or with a subscribe-and-save.  The packaging seems to be trying to promote the KIND movement by the KIND CEO which I found as a weak sell and possibly only contributing to its higher price.","4.0","Very tasty, fairly healthy, so-so value","1319587200"

"slaphappy","B005IW4WEA","As a lover of Kind bars, I was excited to see this granola. I'm generally not a fan of grains unless they're sprouted grains, but this was great. Low glycemic and tasted SO good. It's full of amaranth, quinoa and millet as well as flax which provides the Omega 3. I love how the blueberries add a nice sweet/tart taste but was disappointed to learn that they're blueberry puree as well as apple and plum puree. I wish they were just dried blueberries.All in all, it's a great granola and has a nice depth / complexity of taste.","5.0","love Kind products","1325376000"
"Tori","B005IW4WEA","I had to throw my bag of Cinnamon Oat Clusters out after eating 3/4 of it in two days. TWO DAYS. The guilt of eating this much hasn't caught up with me yet.Yes, this granola is like crack. Yes, you will eat way more than one serving size. No, you should not just grab handfuls of this stuff out of the bag like I did if you care about how much you consume. Measure it people. I suggest, if you're tracking your calories like I am, to avoid entering how much you consume, because the numbers will only depress you if the carb monster in you comes out to play. My carb monster--and sweet tooth monster--both came out to play whenever I even SAW the bag lol. Today, I had about 1.5k calories from this granola--and that is not including the milk I consumed half of it with.Kind Snacks are awesome, and I am addicted to their Nut Delight Kind Bars. I have one every day I'm on my university's campus with a yogurt, and it is a filling snack/meal that keeps me satisfied for at least 3-5 hours.These grains are healthy, and what snacks should be like. Love that there's flax in here, and quinoa, millet, etc. They're great on yogurt, in some skim milk, and even better when eating them out of your hand. They're a little on the sweet side (it's 6g of sugar for 1/3 cup), so if you're trying to cut sugar out of your diet, I would suggest avoiding. Then again, they're sweet for me because I haven't really had sugary things in a while, so this was like a huge treat that I totally abused.The nice part is that there is plenty of fiber and omega 3's in this snack, so your blood sugar levels won't spike. The fiber in this also leaves you feeling full. But hey, being full never stopped someone from binging on a yummy carbalicious snack every now and then--especially when you haven't consumed many carbs in a while--so approach with caution... and your measuring cups!","5.0","Too good, it's dangerous","1319587200"

"oion","B005JXHLBY","I bought this a few times, and it's changed a bit (for the better). The old versions of the bars were a bit ""wet"" on the outside, hence some of the ""slimy"" comments; likewise, the old packaging consisted of a pull-apart vac sealed pouch and you had to remove the nutritional information card and/or preservation packet. The newer version right now (literally--the latest Youtube video about Tanka's new packaging is from Aug 29, 2013) has only the vac-sealed pouch with all the nutritional information printed upon it, and no preservation packet. The meat is also a bit dryer in the sense that you're not going to drip on yourself, but still very moist with the cranberries and a bit of juice; I wonder if due to the way the meat is cooked, the old version may have not been dried off sufficiently before packaging. But anyway.Flavor-wise, this is the perfect spot for me. I prefer savory snacks with only some sweetness on the side, so the original Tanka bar flavor is my favorite. Texture-wise, you get the semi-dried meat chunks and little juicy bits of actual cranberries inside. As someone with TMJ (I can't bite into an apple), these bars are soft enough when regular jerky is just impossibly tough.Comparisons:Tanka bar (original) = 28g serving, 70 calories, 7g carb, 7g proteinClif bar (oatmeal raisin walnut) = 68g serving, 240 calories, 43g carb, 10g proteinSlim Jim (original) = 32g serving, 170 calories, 3g carb, 8g protein","5.0","Great snack with balanced flavor; cool entrepreneurial story","1378598400"

Mission accomplished. The first time I made these I don't think I cooked them long enough but thought 'what a great lo mein noodle these would make'. Our next recipe was chicken lo mein which turned out perfectly....even my ultra picky husband (who doesn't eat substitutes) loved these noodles.  They absorb flavor well.  I consider this a versatile noodle as, depending on the amount of time cooked, you get different textures.  The longer you cook it the more like processed pasta it becomes.  It has no detectable taste of its own but readily picks up the flavor of your sauces.  Again, timing seems to be key....the longer it sets, the better it gets.  I haven't tried it for spaghetti yet ( that's next) but it was also great with just a bit of butter, garlic, and lemon pepper.

"naturegirl","B005LW4NCI","These chocolates have a very thin dark chocolate shell and inner milk chocolate shell surrounding a ball of both almond and pistachio marzipan with a tiny hazelnut chocolate center which has a touch of liquor in it. They are pretty sweet but good, and the chocolate is high quality. I did not realize, though, there was more than one company out there making Mozart Kugel chocolates. I enjoyed them, but they were not the chocolates I remember having and which I thought I was ordering, of the same Mozart theme. The ones I remember had a decadent, thicker, deeply dark chocolate and thinner milk chocolate shell. I remember being floored by the flavor and aroma of the almond and pistachio marzipan layers, which I somehow also remember being a little bit warm and heady, as if there might have been a touch of stronger brandy or some other liquor in them (or maybe it was in the hazelnut center?). Also, I think the chocolate hazelnut center was a larger part of the center. My memory is a bit hazy because it has been a while since I last indulged in these chocolates, but I do remember them being a little bit warmer (though not overly boozy) and with a more pronounced, almost amaretto-like marzipan taste and richer dark chocolate. Maybe my taste buds have aged and lost their tolerance for sweet notes, but, although these chocolates were not at all bad, I did find them to have a sweeter and maybe slightly commercial flavor to them (does that make any sense?), and I also found them less aromatic, overall. I did enjoy them and do recommend them, but am basically sharing my more detailed input in case another shopper out there can maybe help jar my memory to the right direction, and maybe the right Mozart kugels.","4.0","good quality chocolates, but a tad sweet","1390780800"

I would have preferred that they be dried a little bit more, but others will probably appreciate how moist they are.  The only other issue was that, as stated on the bag, some of the apricots do have pit fragments.  As a result, you have to be careful when eating them.

Hershey's cookies and cream is awesome.  SO love that and I actually make fudge with it and well, that's amazing.  These hardly have any white chocolate taste to them whatsoever, and are extremely waxy.  Almost spit this one out!  Hardly any chocolate flavor in the cookie portion either.  I only wound up buying these because our stores had run out of Hershey's cookies and cream kisses and the little bite-size bars very early in the Christmas season.  They always do and seemed to have even less than normal this year. Since these didn't have much flavor to them, I wound up buying the larger size Hershey cookies and cream bars for the fudge.  Worked out fine but my hips didn't need that extra bit of candy from the bars!For the plus side, the texture of these bars, however, is quite nice and I like that you get a rather large chunk in the bite.  Hershey's, on the other hand, ALWAYS leaves you wanting more!  And,if you're a true cookies and cream junkie like we are in this house well, thus I came up with the fudge.  This is a pass, sincerely, and SOMEONE TELL HERSHEY WE NEED A ONE POUND SIZE COOKIES AND CREAM BAR!","2.0","So-so, it's not Hershey's, nor is it an improvement","1390780800"
"Effie","B005R0ZFW6","These were delivered on the hottest day this year, then sat in my hot mailbox all afternoon until I got home after work.  Initially I thought they must have died, but I followed the instructions and they were definitely doing something, but they were small and mushy and not producing a thick kefir.  Finally after a week, as per the instructions, the grains started growing and looking like little cauliflowers!  I'm still nurturing them carefully, but thrilled that they are happy and growing and starting to produce kefir!","5.0","Sat in my hot mailbox for hours, but they lived!","1405123200"
"Randomly","B005R0ZFW6","This product was not on prime, so there was a shipping fee I had to pay. It is worth it because the grains are perishable. The small fee is worth the superior quality of the kefir grains. The instructions, booklet and a personal care feel from the owner make me recommend it strongly.Yes, it worked as explained. Kefir is easier to make than yogurt and the grains are amazingly resilient. I deviated a lot from the guidelines (left it in the fridge much longer, trashed by mistake some grains after a couple of weeks, used 2% milk) and it still works. On the other hand, the result does not have the smoothness of the kefir bought in stores. It's quite ''sparkling'' but thin. All this could be my fault. I see people might be unhappy with  its aspect, the whey forming at the bottom and the somewhat acquired taste. But this is the kefir, not the product itself, I presume.Bottom line: it works and is quite resilient, flexible. It won't go bad with the first mistake or inexact measurement.

My office was across the street from them when they were located in Berkeley and had eaten a LOT of their chocolate.  I have not had any since the Hershey's closed the Berkeley site... still in mourning.  Now they are selling chocolate on Amazon.  I'll get over this one day...  This is some pretty good stuff.  This is a dark chocolate but, doesn't have the strong bitter sweetness that some of their other blends have had.  It definitely has a creaminess to it that one wouldn't normally expect in a dark chocolate.  I'm no big time baker but, the combination of some bitter sweetness with the creamy texture may be pleasantly interesting in some backed goods.  Well, this is great stuff and if you have never really tried some of the ""gourmet"" chocolates this would be a good place to start.

(I should admit, though, that I am somewhat of a salt-aholic).Each serving size is 1 ounce and contains 130 calories and 7 grams of fat. There are 4 1/2 servings per bag. The vegatables in these chips are, in order of appearance on the ingredient list: navy beans, potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes. I really like these chips and I would eat them in place of regular chips, but I certainly would not replace my vegetables for them. With 7 grams of fat per serving I would not consider this a healthy way to get your vegetables. Maybe just a healthier alternative to the classic potato chip.","5.0","Yum!","1364256000"

"eyecore","B005V9YXTO","If not for the very weird aftertaste, I would've given this an extra star.  As they are - the flavor is simply stated as ""sea salt,"" but that's more of ""the additional flavor on top.""  They're not overly salty or anything, but you can really taste the flavor of the ingredients (for better or worse) more than the salt adds to the flavor.  (That said, without the salt, these wouldn't be very good at all.)While the idea of a full serving of veggies is had by eating chips (though even the package says these are NOT a replacement for actual veggies), the veggies they used produce an interesting flavor.  Never before in the world has this flavor ever been tasted...and I'm guessing for some people, it should have stayed that way.  For me (and a handy 7 year old that loves veggie sticks and chips and crackers, etc), they're OK - not great, and unless I was really sold on the idea of eating chips instead of veggies, I wouldn't buy them over my favorite corn or potato chips.Then again, if you really want to eat vegetables, why not just buy them?  They're cheap, taste great, and you can dip them in whatever you want (or simply salt them.)All in all, these aren't bad chips, but for my household, we'll stick with our regular chips for flavor and lots of veggies and fruits because they're good for you - and delicious!

I read others comments before trying this brand so I would know how to compare my taste with others.First experiment: I made one cup of coffee using one pouch. I liked the smooth taste and did not have to add creamer. It was weak. But the more I thought about it the more I recognized that this was just like drinking tea. So I think a tea lover would enjoy this as a different flavor.Second experiment: I made a second cup of coffee by piling a new pouch on the one I had used previously. Now the coffee was definitely stronger. It was still very smooth. I would rate this as a medium strength but on the light side.Third experiment: I made two cups of coffee using one pouch plus a scoop of my regular coffee. This tasted just like my normal coffee but retained the smoothness so I did not need creamer. So this may be the answer for those who wanted more flavor.Fourth experiment: I brewed two cups of coffee using one pouch. Then I moved the pouch to the carafe and squeezed it about 6 times. The coffee darkened noticeably and got a stronger flavor. This turned out to be the most satisfying for my taste.","4.0","4 experiments, 4 different tastes","1339027200"

But in order to brew these larger-than-standard pods, I do have to use the 8 oz (two-pod) holder. No problem (as Marley would say). I do my usual routine of wetting the pod prior to brewing.

Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot.

"Bud","B005VUILWI","First off, stevia is my favorite natural sweetener.  I was, however, curious to see how Wholesome Sweeteners handled the ""fillers"" aspect.  The deal is that every packet of low-/no-calorie sweetener (that I've ever run across) is packed in some agent, typically maltodextrin.  In this case, it is agave inulin.  The 1 gram of agave inulin contains 0.8g of fiber, so it's really closer to 1 calorie, whereas typical zero-calorie packets actually contain 4 calories.  Due to a technicality, they get to round down to zero if under 5.  This loop-hole is pervasive in the USA.  Anyway, this 1 calorie is pretty good.  I don't like, however, that they say it's zero calories and you don't need to count them, but it's close.The calories of carbs can creep in if you are on a very strict diet and drink a lot of coffee or tea.  This is especially true if you are on an extremely strict diet like an Atkins or other ketogenic diet. But, for both the price and for true zero calories, you are much better off just buying liquid stevia in a water base.  I do like packets since they are portable.  For that, I give it a some stars, but I will be sticking with liquid stevia where I can, though.","4.0","Not zero calorie, but close","1343088000"
"Chandler","B005VUILWI","I like the taste of this sweetener and I am a huge fan of stevia, but my problem with it is that agave is the first ingredient. Now, contrary to popular myth, as someone in the food biz I can say that that does NOT mean it's mostly agave. As you can verify on the FDA website, ingredients are not listed in the order of what they contain most of as most people believe, but they are listed in order of weight...which means if there are 2 ounces of agave in a pack and one ounce of stevia, (I just made that weight up for explanation) then agave will be read first...even is there is a tablespoon of agave and 2 tablespoons of stevia in a packed (again, that amount is used just for explanation...doesn't contain near that much in a packet.). Since stevia weighs next to nothing, it still may very well be the main ingredient, but we do know there is a good deal of agave... and that's my issue.I actually switched to stevia from using agave as a sweetener (although I still use it occasionally.) because of the controversy and studies showing that it may very well have the same weight-gain effects as high fructose corn syrup due to how your body processes it. There are some very well respected doctors such as Dr Mercola who say this. I scoffed at first, until more reports said the same. I haven't made up my mind yet, but in the meantime I cut back on agave so when I bought stevia I didn't expect to find it there. But it's listed first in these packets.Why do they add another sweetener? Stevia is SO sweet that you have to. It takes a few grains to sweeten a drink...there would be nothing in the packet otherwise. However, I perfer to find it cut with erithritol as this does not spike your blood sure, is all natural, and zero calories.I now simply buy straight stevia in order to sweeten my coffee...in liquid form. It's not mixed with anything and is very economical. One drop sweetens an entire cup of coffee and the liquid form means it mixes perfectly.This isn't a bad sweetener...it could be a bit sweeter if I had my say...but my main gripe is I believe they'd have better marketing if they cut it with another natural zero calorie sweetener with less current controversy.  For agave lovers, however, it would be the best pick. For me, I'm lukewarm.Now, add to that it has silica...this is not in any other stevia products I've bought. Look, I just want stevia...or a stevia and eriythritol blend...but not a mix of stevia and stuff I don't want.Anyone consuming stevia is likely a label reader so I think this product would do well to tigthen its' belt in order to compete...and by that, I mean stick with cleaner ingredients.","3.0","High in agave which I'm trying to drink less of, but the taste is good.","1345075200"
"Gizmo","B005VUILWI","I tried Stevia many years ago but abandoned it because at that time it was only available from health food stores and was very expensive.  It's great that you can now purchase it online or in any major grocery store.  In the past 6 months I've had fun sampling the many new varieties of low-calorie and/or artifical sweeteners that have come to market.  This morning I did a side-by-side comparison of Splenda Nectresse and this Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia.  I had actually tried the Splenda Nectresse about a month ago and couldn't decide if I liked it or not, so the side-by-side with the stevia seemed like a good experiment.  So...first I simply dipped a damp pinkie into each packet and tried them straight-up. BIG difference in taste.  The stevia shocks your tongue with how sweet it is.  The Nectresse on the other hand doesn't convey much sweetness at all and also has a unique taste that is hard to describe.  Next test...half a packet of each in a hot, regular coffee with half-and-half creamer.  Side-by-side tasting yielded a clear winner for me:  the stevia would be my first choice every time in a cup of coffee.  The Nectress adds a funky little taste that I don't enjoy in coffee.  Now, it's possible that the Nectresse would be fine to sweeeten a cold glass of a fruity iced tea.  In general tho' I don't want my sweeteners to have any taste of their own - other than just plain old SWEET.  This stevia answers that call nicely and I would certainly buy it again.","4.0","Side by Side Comparison","1343174400"

"Chandler","B005XVZKGA","I have two friends who work in ER and they have told me enough stories about people coming in with issues after drinking Red Bull and what it can actually do to you that I shy from that rodeo.  However, let's be honest...sometimes I need a jolt. If it's the evening and I know I'll be out late with friends, I also know I'm going to be the one who starts winding down and yawning first. I'm a morning girl. I also know sometimes that during a workout a tad of caffeine makes me keep going longer but these are not times I want to grab a hot coffee or anything but water anyway.With this they combined the two. To me it seems a perfect marriage. No heart palpitating stimulants but just enough caffeine to wake you up a bit; and the benefit of water to tag along beside it.I expected it to taste like there was some additive but if tasted like the purest of water. I could easily enjoy this during a tough work day, while still hydrating myself, while on the treadmill, or while getting my party on late night.I'll be buying it again!","5.0","Put the Red Bull in the stable; this is a better choice","1342483200"
"chaos","B005XVZKGA","Yes, that's right, it tastes just like plain tap water.... and that's because that's all it is. They bottle it up and add some caffeine to it and sell it at a premium. Not all tap water tastes the same, so as to whether or not you would like the taste would depend on the water you are used to I suppose. But anyway, I see no need for a product like this on the market. If someone wanted a quick source of caffeine, then caffeine pills would be easier, quicker, and much, much cheaper.The ingredients listed on the bottle are: purified water, natural caffeine, natural citric acid.I tried this product out of curiosity, but will in no way ever consider purchasing it.

If you have a mild to low tolerance for caffeine and don't need 2-3 cups of coffee/tea to get you going then this is a nice clean alternative. The caffeine adds no extra flavor to the water so I found myself adding flavoring to each bottle to make it more enjoyable.

But, that's a minor inconvenience for having great caffeinated water.It tasted fresh and clean without any types of aftertaste - I drank it icy cold, and was very thirsty so maybe that's why I didn't experience a bitter aftertaste like others did.It is pricey, but it's also convenient. If you carry around caffeine pills, like NoDoz, then you wouldn't need this, but it's a great alternative from having a diet soda, replete with chemicals and fake sugar that do nothing good for your body.","5.0","awesome, convenient, but pricey","1338336000"
"ephemeral","B005Y10X9S","Normally chocolate-flavored diet/fiber bars taste only mildly of chocolate, but these had a truly rich chocolatey, almost fudge-like taste.  A quick look at the list of ingredients reveals that there are 4 separate cocoa or chocolate ingredients present, so that explains the taste.  Of course, there's also a fair amount of sugar in these bars, but with 120 calories and 9 grams of fiber, I'm happy to enjoy them!In addition to the great taste, these bars also have a very nice consistency.  They are similar to a rice crispy treat, but a good deal less chewy.  There is a solid chocolate layer on the bottom and more chocolate drizzled on top, but they weren't soft or messy to eat.The only downside is that these are small (that's why they are only 120 calories after all).  Even with 9 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein, they didn't put much of a dent in my appetite.  I definitely would need more than 1 for a snack.","5.0","Delicious!","1353628800"

First of all, they taste really good - almost just like a chocolate bar.  Second of all, with 9 grams of fiber, they kept me full for a few hours, which is all I needed for the days when I missed breakfast or needed an afternoon snack. Additionally, they are the perfect size to fit in a small purse. Recommended for anyone that is looking for a filling, great-tasting snack.","5.0","Much better than I expected","1352592000"

And the few that tasted good were usually good because they had a lot of fat and/or sugar (mmmm)... But these, in my opinion, seem to strike a decent balance; they taste pretty good, without relying on a lot of sugar & fat. Yes, of course, they're not going to taste like a candy bar, or a typical cereal bar, but that's not their intention. For me, someone with a deadly sweet tooth, I could eat one of these instead of a candy bar, and it would satisfy my chocolate craving, without all the fat & garbage, while also giving me lots of the good stuff, like protein, fiber, vitamins & minerals... And if I were to buy these from Amazon, using S&S, it would cost about $0.57/bar, and that's definitely reasonable.","4.0","Surprised..","1354147200"

My husband and I both find the apple cinnamon flavor to be be quite tasty and these do a good job of filling us up for a few hours.

"Ghenghis","B005ZBZLSU","San Francisco Bay has created a K-Cup hybrid that has the standard foil top with a filter-like basket.  Whilethis seems less likely to keep your coffee as fresh, it certainly saves on plastic waste and makes these K-Cupssignificantly cheaper than the competition.  I purchased an 80-Count box of French Roast for $27, bringing thecost per unit under thirty-five cents.  Considering the average price of a K-cup is around sixty cents, this productis nearly half the price of other brands.It took a few days for my French Roast to ship, but I received my order within a week.  Like the Fog Chaser, the K-Cupswere packaged in plastic bags with eight units per bag.  I use a K-Cup organizer for my pods and noticed that these donot fit perfectly into the organizer.  No big deal on that count.  What's important to me is taste.While I like saving money, I don't like saving money at the expense of quality.  In this case, I would probably not orderthe French Roast again.  While I really like the Fog Chaser, I find the French Roast to have a bitter aftertaste thatdetracts from the positive qualities of the coffee.  It isn't necessarily &#34;bad.&#34;  It is just not as rich and smooth as I like.Taste is subjective, but this brand was just a wee too biting for my preference.I would definitely recommend the Fog Chaser instead of the French Roast and plan on sampling a few other offeringsfrom this company.  They have a positive program that includes Fair Trade practices and environmental awareness.They also have a program where you can recommend a military member overseas to receive a free bag of coffee.All of these positive corporate endeavors add to my positive perception.","3.0","French Roast K Cups.","1391731200"

Far less plastic than 'regular' K-cups, so there's less waste. The flavor is awesome-- dark brew but no bitterness or sourness.  Nice bite, clean aftertaste.  This, in my opinion, tastes more like my local coffee house brew than any other K-cup on the market.  and Amazon has great prices on these, especially with subscribe & save.","5.0","My favorite k-cup, hand down, no question","1347062400"
"Jafu","B005ZBZLT4","Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices.

"slaphappy","B005ZBZM52","We've been using the Keurig for a few years, shortly after they became available for home use. We've tried many brands of K Cups and these, to me, are the best!The coffee is shipped in vacuumed  sealed plastic bags and once you open them, the  aroma is quite intense and intoxicating. After enjoying a few heavenly whiffs, be sure to get a BPA free plastic container that locks air tight. This will ensure that these new style cups don't get stale.Of course, the coffee is sooo good that they likley won't be around long enough to get stale!The flavor is rich and full bodied. It's strong, but not in the bitter or acid tasting sense, only in richness. My 18 year old daughter loves it as does my husband who general prefers breakfast blends that are lighter. I am so happy to have found this and thankful for the other reviewers whose reviews encouraged me to try this. We used to have many great options with the Subscribe and Save offer and a variety of coffees, but since Green Mountain has bought up all these coffees and refused to allow Amazon to do Subscribe and Save anymore, it's just ridiculously expensive to buy them if you have multiple coffee drinkers in your house.","5.0","best k cup I've tried","1337385600"
"ephemeral","B005ZC39JM","I'm rating this a 4 out of 5 because I think all the granola types deserve a 5, but the oatmeal and pancake mix were about a 3.The granola is great. It's nice and sweet, which is how I like it.  It doesn't come in big clumps, but in small bits, which makes it really easy to eat as cereal.  It's definitely high in calories- the blueberry granola is 120 calories per serving, which isn't much, but it takes three or four servings to make a normal sized bowl of breakfast cereal.  Luckily it's pretty filling, so one bowl was enough to tide me over for a while.The oatmeal and pancake mix both have the same problem in my opinion; they contain sunflower seeds.  I actually love sunflower seeds, but not in something I want to be smooth and sort of melt-in-your mouth.  When I take a bite of oatmeal or pancake, I really don't want to spend a whole minute chewing up hard sunflower seeds (and they're not chopped up or anything; it's the full kernel).  They also contain millet, which I thought was a great idea.  Some people won't be crazy about it, but I love the way the millet sort of pops when you bite down on a piece, and it adds great flavor.  It also doesn't make you chew forever before you can swallow.  I would really like to try a version of either of these products that doesn't contain sunflower seeds.Overall, this is a great variety pack.

It seems this tea is not strong enough for many other reviewers, but this being a matter of personal taste, this tea is plenty strong enough for me.  I find it to be stout and crisp, just what I expect from a good English Breakfast tea.  I know this might appall some of the tea purists out there, but I vary wildly in how long I steep my teas.  One morning it might be 2 minutes, another morning it might be 10 or 15 minutes.  I tend to get distracted around the house.  I've occasionally forgotten about the tea only to rediscover it a half an hour later, at which point I warm it in the microwave and drink it anyway.  I know - it's so tragic and wrong where tea is concerned.  This morning was a 10-minute-steep with this tea, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the tea, while quite strong, was just fine and had not developed a bitter or sharp edge.

"LD","B0061IUKDM","Green tea is smooth and very mild with just a hint of flavor. This tea has a definite flavor. I put a tea bag in my Mr Coffee and allowed the water to flow through. It started off as a medium strength tea and then the lemon grass kicked in. I would say it is equivalent in strength to a cinnamon spiced tea. Lemon grass has a slight bitter taste compared with just adding lemon to tea so you will have to try it in order to find out if its your cup of tea. Although advertised as slightly sweet, I did not have that impression. It came across as an herbal tea which it does claim to be.The next time I allowed the tea bag to sit for 5-10 minutes in a cup of tap water. Then I microwaved it until it was hot. Completely different taste. Now it was mild, smooth, and had less of the lemon grass flavor.","4.0","For the tea lover who likes tea with a small bite","1332979200"
"nonpareil","B0061IUKDM","Many people use green tea as an alternative to the more common black tea, feeling that the green offers health benefits. ""Camellia sinensis"" originates in China. It supposedly promotes weight loss, stimulating fat oxidation by boosting metabolic rate without increasing heart rate. In addition, it contains polyphenols which are claimed to be antioxidants, but it is not at all clear that scientists agree on this or whether, if so, they are useful to humans.So I steeped this teabag in eight ounces of hot but not boiling water for three minutes. The resulting brew was most pleasant, I think better than my usual attempts to brew looseleaf green tea because the time and amount were better controlled. Green tea becomes bitter if steeped too long. I could not taste the lemon grass, lemon balm herb or verbena at all.","5.0","Just fine, couldn't detect lemon taste","1333238400"

I was delighted by the colorful miniature chocolate bars in one large display box, and after I tried each flavor, my tastebuds were the ones delighted.In the past, I've only had G&B;'s dark chocolate with almonds, and so it was nice to try their other interesting flavors. The dark chocolate flavors were: cherry, dark, and ginger, and the milk chocolate flavors were milk, toffee, and almond. What I loved, in addition to the smooth, easily melted chocolate, was that there were real pieces of fruit and nuts and ginger in the mini bars, with a good chocolate to filling ratio. Since these are organic, Fair Trade certified foods, the product itself is a little pricy. But the bars are just the right size to limit your daily chocolate intake. Oh and did I mention?

These were grabbed so very quickly that the box turned into a blur of red!  They say they're creamy, weird for an ad campaign for crackers, but they're really not kidding!  Creamy mozarella can be sensed throughout these little bursts of flavor, and once again, the kids just go nuts for them.  SO glad we tried these, definitely a ""keeper"" in this house.

They're made with both mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and you can definitely taste the cheddar.  But the mozzarella gives them a milder, butterier taste than a normal cheddar cracker.  They are also not too salty, which is often a problem with cheese crackers.At 150 calories for 25 crackers (a few handfuls), this is a great snack.  They take the edge of your hunger without filling you up with empty calories.They are a little greasy, so you'll want to have a napkin or a sink hand when you eat them.  The crackers in my box were almost all broken, which made it a little harder to eat them.

Overall a good product that I like and will purchase in the future.I'd also like to note that mine were shipped smart post and I wouldn't recommend picking the cheapest shipping option when ordering. By the time the cheese-its got to me I'd say that only 1/3 of the box was whole crackers. The rest were broken down into a fine crumb mess.

"chaos","B006BXUY2Y","I'll start by commenting on the size of these granola bars. They are small. Really small. Each granola bar is only 0.95 ounce (27 grams). To put that in perspective, A single Pop-Tart is 50 grams. A Reese's (with 2 peanut butter cups) is 1.5 ounce.  Nature Valley granola bars are 1.5 ounce (42 grams) per package (serving) and are 190 calories. This Kellog's granola bar is light as a feather. But I suppose they make them that small so they can keep the calorie count ""low"". Each bar is 110 calories. There are 4 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber and 3 grams of fat per serving.

Straight out of the box these are yummy little things, but in a bowl with milk not so much. The first two bites were great, but the flavor just doesn't hold up. By the time I finished my bowl of cereal all the flavor had vanished, and I felt like I was feasting on plain 'ol shredded wheat.

I like to use 1/3 bowl of sweet cereal combined with plain corn flakes, bran flakes, grape nuts, or oat cereal. That dilutes it down to something with flavor and a little sweetness. After trying the Mini-Wheats with just milk, I added the plain and it was just right with a cinnamon twang. Eating it straight it had the taste of a cinnamon roll. So now you can decide from there.Looking at the box, it said a serving was 47 pieces. I counted out 47 and the bowl was barely half full. So think about doubling the nutritional numbers if that is important to you. It also means the box will only last for 4 servings. That makes it expensive.

It was also a little dark and had a faint burnt taste, not sure if they're all like that or if mine was an anomaly.I didn't taste much banana in this bar at all, and the chocolate chips were small, though they added a nice textural contrast. It isn't very sweet and is relatively low in sodium and fat, which is good for your body, but unfortunately doesn't add to the taste.At only 140 calories per bar with 3gm of fat, this makes for a decent and fairly healthy snack bar, but frankly a regular piece of fruit would probably be more satisfying, and there are a number of other energy bars out there that have more taste.

While waiting for my Simmer Down coffee, though, I came across a small thread in a product page for a turkish coffee here that explains how turkish coffee is made (bring your coffee to a foaming boil 3 times in a small pot, allow half a minute for it to settle, slowly pour it into a second pot--in my case, just a pyrex measuring cup with a spout--allow it to settle again, then slowly pour it into your coffee cup). This sounded to me like pretty much how folks have probably been making coffee for ages, and so I let the coffeemaker be and went with it. The result? The silkiest, smoothest, and best tasting cup of coffee I have ever had at home or at a fancy coffee shop, with nothing more than a thin and tiny line of dissolved, creamy coffee at the bottom of the cup. It was such a strong, dark cup of coffee that I almost did not believe it was truly decaf until after my second cup, at which time I would have been wired and ""on"" if it had not been. The best part? This Simmer Down coffee is absolutely delicious! It was smooth and mellow, and rounded with just a touch of a caramel undertone to it which is really brought out by a tiny bit of maple sugar (or a deep dark sugar for a more robust taste, if that is your preference). I didn't have to plug anything into a socket to make it, dial up any buttons, or filter my coffee through coffee filters made with bleach or ammonia. I think it is fitting to go back to your roots to enjoy this very laid back coffee--don't you? : ) try it--you may never touch a coffee maker again!","5.0","deeply dark and strong, yet smooth and mellow and perfect to simmer down to","1392336000"

"Martha","B006GCMI5Q","Perfect for the low sodium diet.I am back to buy the pound size.I am glad I tried it first with the smaller size being unsure of the flavor profile.Not at all like a Mrs Dash, 100 times better.This is the most different flavor I have had. But really good.I would not call it a salt substitute yet there is a slight salty flavor to it. A little dill flavor and a faint cheesy flavor. Yes there are little tiny bits of herb or spices but they don't bother me like it seemed to others. It is almost like if you had hand ground your pepper, really not that big of pieces.My favorite so far is on hot air popcorn, I spray it with a butter flavor cooking spray so it will stick and then use it as liberally as I choose. Love it on potatoes too. I cant imagine anything this wouldn't be good on.","5.0","Wonderful product","1390521600"
"naturegirl","B006H33U7O","This was the first WOW brand cookie I ever tried, and it was a real treat. Just opening the bag was a sign of what was to come, with its burst of delicate, fresh lemony-ness. I first found these at Homegoods, which has very good prices but is not consistent in any of the products it carries (which are mostly non-food anyway) so I looked for these on Amazon. Though I have not purchased this specific flavor through Amazon yet, I can tell you this is a fantastic cookie that everyone will ask you about, including the regular gluten cookie eaters, who just won't have had a texture like it, or a cookie that just disappears like these do (the thing you notice most about gluten after going gluten free is that gluten foods tend to clump up while they are being chewed and bulk up on their way down--it is the same for everyone, and it is a pleasant surprise when non gluten free friends discover really good GF food, and are surprised that, bite after bite, they feel like the food is just disappearing). This cookie has an incredibly light and fluffy texture and the flavor is just lemony enough, without being cloying or artificial tasting (they are all natural). I just love smelling the bags. It is too bad Amazon does not sell a mixed pack, as these are a bit expensive for what you would want to be spending on snacks, but, after trying all their flavors, I can tell you Lemon Burst and Ginger Molasses (which you can also find here) are really the best. If you like lemon, you will LOVE these cookies. Go ahead and treat yourself.

It's flat out decadent.I'm not even that huge of a fan of granola. Usually it tastes like things coated in high fructose corn syrup trying to hold out the name ""granola"" like a fake i.d. for their healthy card.This actually tastes homemade.The red berries are a great mix with the dark chocolate (monounsaturated or ""good"" fat and antioxidants. Monounsaturated fats have actually been shown to HELP ya lose weight and REDUCE bad cholesterol levels. Woo Hoo)I originally figured I'd keep this around for just a bite when I wanted something sweet...I'm ashamed to say, I polished it off in two days.With no milk.Great snacking.Yeah, a portion of the proceeds go to a charity...but the fact is, I simply love the taste so I'd eat it even if they didn't.Incidentally, it's low in sugar and high in whole grains. You won't guess this when you eat it so pretend you didn't just read that and don't tell the kids.And, psst, it's also filling your diet with flax seeds. Wonderful and healthy Omega-3 fatty acid rich Flax seeds are the holy grail of healthy ingredients. What have they been shown to do? Oh, I'm a big fan of flaxseeds:Anti-Inflammatory Benefits: Omega-3 fats are used by the body to produce anti-inflammatory hormone-like molecules, Omega-3 fats can help reduce the inflammation that is a significant factor in conditions such as asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine headaches, and osteoporosis.Omega-3-rich Flaxseeds Protect Bone Health: Alpha linolenic acid, the omega-3 fat found in flaxseed and walnuts, promotes bone health by helping to prevent excessive bone turnover.Protection Against Heart Disease, Cancer and Diabetes: Omega-3 fats are used to produce substances that reduce the formation of blood clots, which can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with atherosclerosis or diabetic heart disease.Omega-3 fats are also needed to produce flexible cell membranes. Cell membranes are the cell's gatekeepers, allowing in needed nutrients while promoting the elimination of wastes. While important for everyone, flexible cell membranes are critical for persons with diabetes and omega-3 fats have been shown to help protect colon cells from cancer-causing toxins and free radicals, leading to a reduced risk for colon cancer.Flaxseeds Help Prevent and Control High Blood Pressure: Individuals whose diets provide greater amounts of omega-3 such as that in flaxseeds have lower blood pressure than those who consume less, shows data gathered in the International Study of Macro- and Micro-nutrients and Blood Pressure, a study of 2,238 peopleFlaxseed Provides Comparable Cholesterol-Lowering Benefits to Statin Drugs in a study of patients with high cholesterolRich in Beneficial Fiber: A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine confirms that eating high fiber foods, such as flaxseed, helps prevent heart disease. Almost 10,000 American adults participated in this study and were followed for 19 years.Flaxseed Puts the Brakes on Prostate Cancer Growth: Flaxseed put the brakes on prostate tumor growth in men who were given flaxseed daily a month before surgery to treat their prostate cancer.Lead author, Duke University researcher Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, believes the omega-3s in flaxseed alter how cancer cells lump together or cling to other cells, while flaxseed's anti-angiogenic lignans choke off the tumor's blood supply, thus helping to halt the cellular activity that leads to cancer growth.Special Protection for Women's Health: Flaxseed is particularly rich in lignans, special compounds that are converted by beneficial gut flora into two hormone-like substances. These agents demonstrate a number of protective effects against breast cancer and are believed to be one reason a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk for breast cancer.Flaxseed Reduces Hot Flashes Almost 60%, as well as many other perimenopausal symptoms.Flaxseeds reduced dry eye in a study of over 40,000I likely don't have to discuss the benefits of the organic or high fiber or antioxidant rich ingredients, right?

"jpr","B006J4MAHW","I tried the Dark Chocolate and Red Berries flavor, and it tasted good, with just a little chocolate, and some berries (but not as many as I'd expected, compared to other cereals with berries).  From some of the other reviews it seems like the proportions of the different ingredients might vary somewhat from bag to bag for whatever reason.  Hopefully they can get that sorted out, but otherwise I think this is a great product IF you're looking for natural/organic/non-GMO and want to help support a good cause at the same time.I end up rating a lot of products 4 stars because there's no 3 1/2 or 4 1/2 and a product has to be pretty close to what I consider perfect to get 5 stars from me.  The seeming lack of berries (maybe just a result of variation from one bag to another), and the price prevent me from being able to give this 5 stars, but I do certainly like the taste, and I like the idea of supporting companies that are responsible and willing to give back to the community.If I had the time I'd make my own granola more often, as that allows me to choose exactly what goes into it, and save some money too, but since I don't, this will do fine for those ""granola mornings"" or as a snack.","4.0","Very good if it's what you're looking for!","1334793600"

The reason being - there is an exposed filter at the bottom of these pods thus making you enjoy a more flavorful coffee.  The only downside to this packaging is if you accidentally rip the bag, then you'll have to find a sealed coffee canister to put them in so they do not go stale.The coffee itself is good - it isn't weak even on the largest mug setting on the Keurig.  It's not my absolute favorite coffee, that would be Caribou.  But, this is a very close second with just the right amount of ""kick"" to start the mornings, and doesn't have an overly burned flavor.  It's smooth, very easy to drink to the point that if you didn't have the make these individually, you would drink the entire pot without realizing it.  I don't think, however, that there is a true Columbian flavor to this coffee, but it is very good, and isn't weak at all.  It's about right in my opinion.

"ChrisNY","B0076YVPFC","Of the different varieties I tried of these Barilla pasta meals, this was just okay.  The wheat pasta was a bit mushy and I didn't like the texture/taste.  My sister and niece (who I was sharing this with) agreed that the pasta could have been a little more al dente, but they liked the pasta and thought this was better than the other ones we tried.  We all liked the sauce - sweet with chunks of vegetables.Overall, the one minute in the microwave was plenty of time - meal was hot enough.  The top - a sealed piece of plastic that you peel off over the sauce to cook then fully remove to pour the sauce over the pasta - is a bit difficult to remove.  I slopped some sauce trying to get it off so if you're making these at work, be careful.Calorie wise, this was just over 300 calories and had 11 grams of fiber.  The portion is very generous (I thought...) and the sodium content, while not low, isn't too bad (around 700 mg).  Though I would not buy this flavor again, I will buy some of the others.","3.0","Not a Wheat Pasta Fan","1348704000"
"ephemeral","B0076YVPFC","I had two issues with this product.  The first was that there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta provided.  The sauce and the pasta were both actually quite tasty, but I like quite a bit of tomato sauce.  This didn't really seem to be enough to cover all the pasta.My second concern was the amount of packaging.  The sauce came in its own separate plastic container, nestled inside the larger pasta container.  This seemed like a complete waste of materials to me.  Why couldn't they combine them or make one container with a dividing wall to keep the ingredients separate?  Add to that the plastic film and the cardboard cover, and I felt like there was just too much packaging for my comfort level.I was pleased with the overall taste and quality of the ingredients.  I was also surprised that the food was done in 1 minute, as indicated on the label.  Normally I find I have to cook ready-made foods much longer than the instructions, but that wasn't the case here.  I appreciated the fact that the pasta was whole wheat, so there was quite a bit of fiber in the meal.","3.0","Not enough sauce, too much packaging","1353628800"

Turns out that it is sweetened with both sugar and stevia. I think that the stevia is what I really didn't like. I have tried stevia as a sweetener in other drinks and didn't like it. This would be a much better drink without the stevia.Anyway, if you are going to drink aloe water for the health benefits, is sweetening it really necessary?

It was a little thicker than regular water and I can't see drinking the whole bottle in one sitting as it made me feel a little full/bloated (though the feeling didn't last long). I know there are health benefits, but think it might take regular use to really matter.I am someone who avoids buying bottled water and this pretty much falls into that category.

I can easily see eating too much of these!  They are only  mildly seasoned and there is this buttery taste to them, from looking at the ingredients, I cannot determine what would give that flavor (unless its the beef itself or what they add to the beef itself and aren't telling).  They are also moister than others I have had, but not overly so.The clincher is the price (6 pack).  It comes out to about $3.40 ish for one pack of 2, which is high.  They also offer packs of 12  ($3.25/pack) and packs of 25 ($2.96/pack) and still get Prime.  Not good enough Nick Sticks!

And even when a legitimately natural and truly food-based ingredient with a similar flavor profile is used as a substitute (as in the case of lemon myrtle for lemon), folks have a right to know what is in their food regardless of a manufacturer's proprietary concerns. Along with Yogi's unhealthy choice in tea bags and its sudden obsession with adding stevia to most of the teas in its line (aside from the manufacturing process of powdered, white stevia being about as bad as any of those commercial artificial sweeteners, doesn't Yogi think its customers have a right to decide whether to sweeten their teas or not, and what with?), now we see ""flavors"" on all of their teas, as opposed to a genuine ingredients list. I don't know what changes have been made at Yogi at a corporate level, but it is just not the same company any more, with anywhere near the same ethics. Some of their teas are better than others, but this is not one of them. Always take a look at that ingredients panel if it is pictured here. If it is not, then purchase from a store where you can pick it up and look at it. I definitely do not recommend this one tea. All my ingredient concerns aside, it isn't just aromatic--it actually tastes like body lotion or soap and leaves an itchy feeling behind in the throat (and, for reference, I enjoy lavender honey, violet ""mints,"" rose tea and preserves, and all of these floral flavors and scents in marshmallows).","1.0","what is going on at Yogi??","1394582400"

"Amis","B007MFECAA","I am delighted with these Kefir Grains but thought I would share our experiences with them:The instructions from the vendor are helpful but I needed some additional information from the internet to really get them going.When starting out, full cream milk seems to work best.  In my experience, these kefir grains seem to do best between 58 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit - a much lower temperature than is required for culturing yogurt.  The grains work really quickly in summer heat (a 12 hour day in our rather warm kitchen was sometimes too much).Separating the grains from the kefir as soon as the first pockets of whey are visible at the top of the culture jar where the kefir grains are floating, seems the best way. If this is inconvenient, I have found that refrigerating the culture jar (even for several days) will usually prevent irreversible curdling until I can get back to deal with them.If the taste of the newly strained kefir is too mild, it can be aged further at room temperature or in the fridge.If your Kefir curdles - coaggulates and separates and cannot be restored to a liquid state by simply shaking it up - pushing the curd through a strainer will create a very pleasant Kefir cheese and allow you to recover the grains. If you try and reconstitute the kefir curd after straining, with the whey, it will be grainy but OK for cooking.","5.0","Steepish learning curve","1352073600"

"Grace","B007NRQ4O4","The picture looks better than the actual product, I'll begin by saying. When I received the package, I was surprised by how cheap the gold-colored boxes looked. Some of the gold paper was peeled off or scratched, and in some of the boxes the white lining paper was also ripped, showing the gray cardboard underneath. I had thought I could reuse those boxes as gift boxes, because they are pretty sturdy, but I won't because of the scratches and rips. Instead of boxes bursting with snacks, each box only contained two to three items, in most cases leaving a lot of empty space. Though overall there was plenty of food, it didn't seem like it because of the presentation. No colored tissue paper or anything to make the boxes look fuller.The selection and quality of food also varied:Smoked Almonds: I like smoked flavoring but something was off. Too strong? They were okay.Jellie Bellies: A medium sized box of them.Sonoma Jack Pepper Jack Cheese: I liked how they were individually wrapped into wedges. Aspreader was included! A nice addition.Angelina's Butter Cookies: These are just like those Danish cookies in the blue tins.Dill Seasoned Sourdough Pretzel Nuggets: Much too salty; they could have been so much better if there was less salt.Raspberry Snaps: These were delicious!Biscuits with rasberry flavored powder and flecks.Cranberry Harvest Medley: Good because it's an almond-cranberry mix. But nothing special.Fleur del Sel Caramel Popcorn: This was good. The popcorn was crunchy and didn't stick to your teeth.Three Pepper Water Crackers: Went well with the cheese. I liked them.Savory Snack Mix: The same as Chex Mix.Licorice Petites: haven't triedHappy Birthday Bear: Eh. Not so cute that I would give it to anyone over 8 years old.The serving size of packages like the Cranberry Medley and Savory Snack Mix, pretzels, licorice and popcorn would only feed about one person.Overall, I'm slightly disappointed; everything seemed kind of cheap to me, rather than gourmet, which is what I was expecting.

If you're a big Starbucks fan, this may not be strong enough for you, but 1 cup made one large mug for me and it was perfect.  Plus the price is hard to beat (it averages about $0.50 per K-cup).Works perfectly with my Keurig, and the cups themselves are actually really elegant looking, so if you have an on the counter caddy, no worries about these being a visual distraction.

"Muttley","B007PA34DI","I am not a huge fan of k-cups due to the increased cost of a cup of coffee and the plastic waste it creates. However in my office this is what we have and therefore, sometimes I order k-cups. I came across Newman's organic while searching amazon. I am not a die hard coffee fan but I drink a cup or two a day.The two main reasons, I bought this was that it was organic and that it was decaffeinated using one of the few natural methods. This one uses water based process and together with CO2 based one it is considered as the healthiest decaffeination method. Most commercially available decaf coffee and almost all decaf k-cups use benzene ( a toxic chemical that is linked with cancer) based methods which I tend to avoid at all costs.Apart from the health issues, I really loved the taste. I can say it is in the stronger side of the spectrum and you taste the smokey but not bitter flavor.The only drawback is the price. For all the luxury you have ( naturally decaffainated, great tasting organic coffee) I think it is worth it but still puts me off buying it all the time. Amazon offers it at a decent price compared to other vendors though.If you can afford it and you are really looking for quality, then go for it you will not regret...","5.0","the best tasting decaf coffee I have ever drunk..","1401494400"

It's very smooth, rich and doesn't have that nasty burned aftertaste.  It also comes in pods that have the filter exposed, so they are stored inside the box in a foil package to keep them fresh.  I LOVE opening that foil package and smelling the fresh coffee - I miss that with the Keurig cups.  Only this brand and Melitta that I have found so far are doing this with the fresh coffee thing.

"Carol","B007TGDXNO","I know I have very sensitive taste buds but this stuff made me gag. First of all, let me say that I am used to extra sludge at the bottom of my coffee cup when I get a good, strong cup of coffee. That's natural even with a French press when you grind the beans finely but this is coffee doesn't clear out like the good stuff does.  It stays muddy throughout the cup as you try to drink it and the taste is pretty bad- burnt and even a little chemcal. Half & half added just made it worse. Too bad they didn't offer it in smaller pkg so I didn't have to waste so many $$ on it when trying.  Good idea for the biodegradable cups, but obviously there is a big need for quality control with the product. Will just stick to my favorite brand, freshly ground in those replacement cups. Its more work but tastes better. Such a waste of money! Won't even consider spending the extra to return, its goin in the trash. Wouldn't give to a stranger..","1.0","burnt mud","1393027200"
"Jafu","B007TGDXNO","To my taste this is a very good coffee and the price is around 34 cents each if you buy the box of 80.

Other than that they work just fine in a Keurig or BUNN MyCafe (using the k-cup drawer).

"Gizmo","B007TGO1TY","In the past 6 months I've sampled several new varieties of low-calorie and/or artifical sweeteners.  I tried this Nectresse about a month ago but couldn't decide if I liked it or not, so this morning I did a side-by-side comparison of Nectresse withWholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia, 75-Count (Pack of 3).  First I simply dipped a damp pinkie into each packet and tried them straight-up. BIG difference in taste.  The stevia shocks your tongue with how sweet it is.  The Nectresse on the other hand doesn't convey much sweetness at all and also has a unique taste that is hard to describe.  Next test...half a packet of each in a hot, regular coffee with half-and-half creamer.  Side-by-side tasting yielded a clear winner for me:  the stevia would be my first choice every time in a cup of coffee.  The Nectress adds a funky little taste that I don't enjoy in coffee.  Now, it's possible that the Nectresse would be fine to sweeten a cold glass of a fruity iced tea. I tried it in plain iced tea and still wasn't crazy about it because the odd little taste was still detectable. In general I don't want my sweeteners to have any taste of their own - other than just plain old SWEET - so, while it was okay, I probably wouldn't buy Nectresse again.","3.0","Very Different","1343174400"
"lizellis","B007TGO1TY","I don't consume a lot of artificial sweeteners but I do like them occasionally.  For the past several years, Splenda has been my drug of choice and while McNeil's new entry Nectresse, is fine, I see no compelling reason to switch.  Simply stated, Splenda tastes good, is readily available and has never caused me any problemsI do like the taste of Nectresse although it doesn't seem to be quite as sweet as Splenda and it does have a slight aftertaste.  I don't find it particularly objectionable but it's definitely detectable.  A big plus for Nectresse (and for Splenda) is that it can take heat without breaking down.  You can cook with it and not alter the taste or lose the sweetness.Nectresse's ingredients as listed on the label are, in order: Erythritol, Sugar, Monk Fruit Extract, Molasses.  The first, erythritol, is a sugar alcohol commonly used as a zero calorie sugar substitute.  It's sweet (although not as sweet as sugar), it tastes good and most people have no trouble with it in limited quantities.  However, it has been known to cause digestive upset in some.  While it's a condition more uncomfortable than dangerous, why risk it?I would certainly choose this over many other brands of artificial sweeteners but Splenda remains in first place for me.","3.0","It's fine but I still prefer Splenda","1349654400"

"Bill","B007Y59HVM","I've been hooked on Keurig coffee makers for quite some time (&#62; 2 years).  I was very pleased to see San Francisco Bay Coffee come up with a reasonably priced alternative to K-Cups.  I've tried 2 other flavors (Breakfast Blend and Rainforest Blend) and just got my box of Fog Chaser last night.I can't praise this brand highly enough.  The cost per cup is so affordable, and the quality of their coffees are just absolutely superlative.  The Fog Chaser sure gets my engine running in the mornings, the flavors balanced and never bitter.  I like the design as well (was never a big fan of steeping tea or coffee in plastic, which is what happens with K-Cups).  The only plastic on these pods is a little ring around the top of it.  Sure, from time to time I get a little residue in the bottom of my cup, but that has never bothered me (I am very picky about certain things, but the residue thing is &#34;no big whoop&#34; to me, whatsoever).I like how the pods come sealed in plastic bags, and the 80-count box includes a plastic container to keep pods in once you open a bag.  I used to keep my K-Cups in the fridge to keep them fresh, but with the manner in which these are packaged, a cool dark cupboard shelf is quite fine.I also love the fresh-ground aroma I get when opening a bag of pods (again, not something you get with traditional K-Cups).I won't order K-Cups again.

Though you can still taste the artificial sweetener that makes the drink &#34;sugar-free,&#34; in my opinion Coke Zero is much more palatable than Diet C.

"CMB","B008ASM610","I have tried almost every coconut water you can find in stores and the even broader selection on Amazon.com.  If I had to compare this to my 2 favorite coconut waters...which are Rising Sun and Taste Nirvana, I would say this coconut water has a lighter taste and more of the texture of water.  For instance, Taste Nirvana has more of a sweet coconut flavor and feels a little more ""heavy"" than C2O.  I drink coconut water after my workouts to replenish and rehydrate myself, and because it is light and refreshing to drink after a hard workout. What I like about C2O is that is feels and tastes like drinking water straight from the coconut. It has a light, yet not overwhelming sweet flavor and is very easy to drink a lot at one time because it does not have that thick/heavy feeling other coconut waters may have.  As for other reviewers mentioning the dented cans, I have found that any time I have purchased coconut water that comes in a heavy aluminum can such as this, no matter what the brand, some of the cans come dented. To me it doesn't matter because it doesn't effect the taste of the product and doesn't cause any leaking or anything. I guess it just comes with products packaged in this type of can.  As I said, I have tried almost every coconut water you can find and if you're someone who likes to try different brands on a search for the perfect coconut water I would definitely say this is worth trying.","4.0","Light and refreshing","1371340800"
"Lane","B008ASM610","Learned about coconut water when my husband was hospitalized and suffered from dehydration which required intensive treatment. A friend who works in a nursing home told me that all residents are given a glass of coconut water daily to avoid dehydration and maintain an electrolyte balance.  We have been doing the same ever since. After trying a lot of grocery store brands I prefer this one because it is purely coconut water without any additives, and most other brands I have seen add sugar and/or other ingredients.  As a result this product does not have a lot of taste, so I mix it half and half with strong iced tea and it makes a delicious drink and provides potassium and maintains hydration.","5.0","A Healthy Daily Drink","1383523200"

They are both milk/lactose -free formulas for children or families who have a history of lactose intolerance.Vermont Organics is extremely versatile and mixes well with cereal and oatmeal and homemade baby food.The Vermont Organics Soy Infant Formula is for babies ages 0-12months. It has extra DHA and Iron vitamins and helps support better growth, brain & eye development as well as immune system development. So your baby won't be losing out on any of the great essential vitamins and minerals needed for healthy development.My biggest problem with Vermont Organics is the price it's about 7-8$ more per 23oz can vs Enfamil ProSobee Soy. Yes this is partially because it's Organic but when you're strictly formula feeding 8$ more per canister can get quite pricey.This is a nice Organic option if that is what you're looking for, but if you're just looking for a great  Soy alternative for babies who experience a lot of gas or colic then there are plenty of other less expensive options out there.","4.0","Soy vs Organic Soy","1394323200"

I was a little worried that it might be messy or hard to open, but the pouch tore easily and cleanly, and I had no problem with it.I liked the taste.  Given that soy sauce is the main ingredient, I expected it to be very salty.  Instead, it tasted like a sweet and sour sauce that was just a little too heavy on the sweet.  I think I would have preferred more sesame flavor to the ginger, but in general I enjoyed the taste and consistency of the sauce.","4.0","A little sweet, but otherwise good","1362182400"

If you follow the directions, one pouch with one pound of chicken only serves two people.  In reality one big eater could eat the whole thing if they limited their carbs.  In the future, I would actually use more than the 1 lbs of chicken they recommend (at least 1.5 if not 2 lbs).

I added about 2 tbs of sesame oil, 2 tbs of Kikkoman soy sauce, 1tsp of dry ginger, 1tbs of cream sherry, and a drained can of mushrooms. The flavor really perked up and I had enough for 4 adult servings.Campbell's has tried to use their tomato soup as the base. This adds flavors that really don't belong. The sesame oil will really boost the taste they are trying to achieve. But the vinegar needs to be offset by the sweetness of the cream sherry.

It not only has no iodine added so it tastes pure, but it does have minerals.That said, I am not a fan of some sea salts because the filtering process leaves sand and I REALLY hate biting into that!Not so for this one--just pure rich salt taste and, since we use salt on so many dishes, why not add full flavor rather than chemical?It just tastes better.Salt provided by San Francisco Salt Company","5.0","Ditch the taste of iodine in your salt and savor the flavor of your dishes more!","1402012800"

I would say that this product is the most similar to Taste Nirvana that I have found.  If I tried to describe it for someone to get an idea of what it is like, I would say that it has a slightly sweet and nutty flavor in one.  After my initial purchase of this product, I decided to re-order it and order Taste Nirvana at the same time so I could get a better comparison to see which I like better.  After doing so, this is definitely my new favorite.  I mainly drink this after a hard-core workout when I feel drained.  Coconut water is high in potassium and is better at replenishing electrolytes than water.  When I drink this after a workout it is extremely refreshing and satisfying.

I wasn't sure how to best use this salt, but I found one really good use for it. I put it on the cut surfaces of a plum that I then grilled. It is my new favorite thing. I made some for my daughter and she agrees. The slightly salty taste contrasted nicely with the sweet/tart plum.My daughter also took a fresh from the garden tomato and cut it into several pieces. She then put a different salt on each piece. Her conclusion is that the darker the salt, the more intense the flavor. The Red Alea was the darkest I had, with the Sherpa Pink, French Grey, and Pure Flake Salt being the others. The Flake salt is a coarser grain, so that could have made it's flavor stronger, even though it was the lightest.","5.0","Found a new favorite!","1404086400"

The pancakes were a bit thin, spongey, and dense, almost like crepes, rather than light and fluffy, but I was satisfied with them.With the Artisan Flour, the finished product tends to be dense, a bit gummy, and somewhat crumbly, and the texture does alter a bit awhile after baking. I agree with the reviewer who commented that this product tends to work best with quick breads, brownies, and other baked goods which do not normally rely heavily on gluten, as opposed to raised bread, which seems to be the Achilles heel of gluten-free baking.That said, trying to reproduce the results of regular flour while eliminating gluten can be extremely tedious and costly for the individual to do on his or her own.

I like that they are all natural and you are getting a treat via fruit.The thing about eating dehydrated fruit, however, is that it's like eating lots of apples even though you have a handful of chips in your hand and you have to be a tad careful about that. For example one serving size has 21g of sugar...you are concentrating all that apple into the chip, without the water so you feel like you are eating less but with the same sugar and calories as if this were a large pieces...just made smaller through dehydration.That said, because it does taste so much sweeter, (and these are VERY sweet) you are quite likely probably going to eat LESS with the same satisfaction.  Yet, it is also dense in nutrients and fiber so it's a far better option than hitting the candy bar...especially because it's all natural.What I especially enjoyed about these, as opposed to some dehydrated apple snacks, is the nice crunch and the touch of cinnamon.For kids these are a superb option because they taste like candy but have nutrients and fiber.And, to be honest, my husband devoured them when I left them on the counter...he doesn't  count calories and doesn't have to...he loves junk food though.

"ephemeral","B0094KD9OQ","The first time I tried this, I followed the instructions for microwaving it directly in the paper-like container.  That was a mistake.  The directions say to heat it for 1-2 minutes, but after 75 seconds, I started to smell something burning.  I pulled the cup from the microwave, and sure enough, the container had a big black scorch mark on it.  And the cereal was definitely not completely cooked at that point.Since then, I have made it several times by pouring it into a regular bowl, adding water, and microwaving.  It works great.I have mixed feelings about the taste.  The cranberries are a great combination with all the grains, but I think there is too much cane syrup- it's a little sweeter then I care for in a breakfast cereal.  I also could have done without the sea salt.There also seems to be a fair amount of chaff in the cereal- tough bits of plant fiber or skin that can't be chewed.  It's not very fun to be constantly spitting out bits of your breakfast.On the plus side, it is very, very filling and doesn't take long to make.  I love that one container has 6g of fiber and 8g of protein.","3.0","Don't microwave in the container!","1393113600"
"nonpareil","B0094KD9OQ","Although the packaging does not specifically state, this cereal does not contain any ingredients that cause problems for those of us who cannot safely ingest gluten. I have celiac disease and had no adverse reaction, none of that all-too-familiar gut-rumbling, cramping and subsequent unpleasant extras. Please note that although none of the listed ingredients contain gluten (wheat, rye or barley), it is estimated that 20% of the gluten-sensitive population also cannot eat oats; thus oatmeal is not necessarily safe for all gluten sufferers.The mixture of grains: oats, quinoa and amaranth, is simply delicious and on top of that, Earnest Eats has included two more faves, cranberries and almonds, along with healthful flax seed. The overall effect is yummy! However, one of the reasons the taste hits the palate well is the inclusion of quite a bit of sugar. The ingredients in listed order are Superfood Grains (Whole Rolled Oats, Quinoa, Ruffed Amaranth), Dried Cane Syrup, Cranberries, Almonds, Sunflower Seeds, Flax Seeds, Pepitas, Sunflower Oil, Korintje Cinnamon, Sea Salt. When you have to read labels as I do, you become quite savvy at seeing the manufacturers' tricks. Dried Cane Syrup = sugar. The reason the grains are bunched as ""Superfood Grains"" is in order to legally have them first in the list whereas otherwise the cleverly labelled sugar would be first. Yes, this stuff is that sweet. I found my teeth ""coated"" after eating it.As soon as I see these shabby labelling tricks, I am less enthusiastic about the product.The heat-resistant paper cup in which it is packaged is convenient but not environmentally friendly, as it creates too much waste. Also I discovered the hard way that the cup is not engineered properly for use in the microwave - when I filled to the mark and microwaved, it boiled right up and overflowed and created a mess. I wasn't surprised as I know perfectly well that to cook cereal that way one must use a wide, shallow bowl to contain the frothing. The other option is to not heat it enough to bring it to a boil - or to watch like a hawk and flip off the microwave at the first sign of danger - but personally I like my oatmeal fully cooked which means bringing it to a boil. Then ya get into the old aphorism, ""A watched pot never boils"", er - its corollary ""An unwatched pot boileth over"" - well, you get the gist: I'm not thrilled about having to stand there watching. I will use the rest of the pack I have by dumping the contents plus H2O into a ceramic bowl.If you want this tasty product despite the sugar, but want to avoid both of the cup problems, it can also be purchased in a 14-oz box.","4.0","Delicious, gluten free, but cup not advised plus tricky labelling.","1393200000"

While they are  a bit pricy in comparison to something like a pack of Oreos, it's worth it if you can't or don't want to be consuming gluten or animal products!They're hard cookies which I don't mind. The chocolate chip is probably my favorite because, obviously, the chocolate adds more sweetness and makes it taste more like a regular ol' chocolate chip cookie. The others aren't bad either but they are a little bit bland in comparison, but they definitely aren't gross or inedible. They're still sweet and yummy as a cookie should be.

"Cordelia","B009UQGLGW","I am writing this review as someone who does not own a Keurig, and who has not used other types of reusable k-cups. I got these in order to bring my preferred brands of coffee from home; to compare their ease of use with other coffeemakers, such as a percolator, espresso maker, or automatic drip; and to compare their cost-effectiveness.First of all, I was surprised to see on the box that these can be reused only up to 20 times. I had expected them to be permanently reusable. I believe there are brands available that are. That said, they would still be a savings over the prepacked K-cups, and you would also avoid throwing away a little plastic cup with each cup of coffee you brew.With these cups, you have to do the same filling and cleanup you have with other types of devices: the percolator basket, the filter holder, the espesso coffee compartment. Whatever system you use, you fill something, you run hot water through it, you have to clean it up afterwards. With the pre-packaged Keurig cups, you don't have to do that. So, there is a bit of extra effort involved in using these refillable k-cups. If you don't already own a Keurig but are considering buying one for using with these refillable cups, in that sense there is less of an advantage over other brewing methods. If you already own a Keurig, then there is a slight advantage in that there is less residue to clean from each k-cup compared with the basket of other coffee makers, probably because of the finer mesh, and they do save money and waste.These cups do produce a good cup of coffee, if a bit weak. I found that to make a strong cup of coffee, I had to use-- and clean-- two of these cups. If you don't like your coffee strong, you can use one cup, and save a bit of money with these re-usable cups. If you like stronger coffee and need to use two, the savings on time and money diminish a bit.","4.0","Saves $ compared with pre-filled cups, but requires clean-up","1369872000"

One of the batched had a few grounds of coffee in it.  I have a Mr. Coffee K-Cup brewer, but K-Cups are standard so it shouldn't matter the brand.At any rate, these are a great idea but didn't work for me.  It's difficult to say they're defective because they're so simple...but it's more difficult to rate them even average if, even after the 6th and 7th failed attempt, I still was without a single cup of coffee.The Newman's Own and Starbucks K-Cups (single use) still work fine, so if you were worried about how I was going to get coffee, you can relax now.","2.0","Defective:  me, or these cups","1370217600"

"Kiwi","B00AAVK8R4","I keep Manuka honey in the house at all times as its healing properties are immense. Some of the better known areas of healing have to do with reducing inflammation, drawing out bacteria and protecting the skin/body from bacteria as a preventative measure and it stimulates cells which in turn can help to repair damaged tissues. But the most important thing which Manuka can do is heal MRSA. Hospitals turn out patients with the unwanted MRSA on a daily basis and many of these patients die because synthetic antibiotics can't reverse the bacterial damage. This *hospital mentality* doesn't think outside the box to natural remedies, and so it goes. Manuka along with WOO will kill MRSA. Easy enough.This honey has the texture of caramel and it looks like it too, but it doesn't taste anything like it. It has an unusual flavor as most Manuka honey does, but it's a required taste. I enjoy it, and it is suggested that the daily dose should be a tablespoon. Of course if you have a large wound, you would spread this to cover the entire area of the wound. When buying Manuka honey it is best to buy an active +14. The higher the active, the better the healing properties.","5.0","The texture is like caramel.....","1362441600"

Honey generally has antibacterial properties, but some studies have shown that manuka honey has stronger antibacterial properties that operate through a different biochemical mechanism.  In fact, some birds are known to use the leaves and bark of the manuka to rid themselves of parasites. Manuka honey is widely marketed for it purported therapeutic properties, as shown by this brand being sold as ""Manuka Doctor Bio Active.""  Some brands claim to contain specified levels of the bioactive compound shown to be antibacterial, known as methylglyoxal, or MG, or MGO.  This one is called ""15 Plus,"" and Manuka Doctor also sells ""20 Plus.""  Other brands use a different system, so you may see ""400 Plus,"" but the real significance of these numbers remains a mystery to me.I find all of this intriguing, but I haven't tested it on cuts or burns.  I've read some reviews from users who have, and some have been pleased with the results, but without a control it seems very hard to say whether it works much better than an alternative, or nothing at all.  I'm not aware of any scientific research suggesting that eating manuka honey has a therapeutic benefit, but there are those who believe that it does.If you're just looking for a honey to eat, I can say that I like the taste of manuka honey, which is herbaceous, dark and grainy, earthy, not terribly sweet, and complex. It's also quite thick. But at over thirty dollars a pound, it costs at least three times as much as organic honey, not to mention the many lower quality honeys on the market, and I can't say I find that manuka honey tastes markedly better than all others.  (This is a very small jar.)So if you're buying it just to eat, I suggest purchasing a small amount and deciding whether the taste really grabs you so much that you're willing to pay the steep premium.  If you're primarily looking for something to put on cuts, I can only suggest that you do some research to determine whether you feel manuka honey is likely to meet your need for a sticky antibacterial substance.","3.0","Interesting, Pricey Honey","1364342400"
"taaj","B00AAVK8R4","I am a beekeeper. I really appreciate the different tastes of honey created by the differing bee's diet. I'd never tried manuka, but have heard that it's amazing. Unfortunately for me, this tastes like clover honey, so taste wise, it's pretty ordinary. That's not why most people buy it though. Most people get it for the medicinal properties. I can't speak to that as I can't use it. It makes my fingers swell. Other honey doesn't have that effect on me, so I don't know what's going on with that. I don't have a lot of allergies, but if you are the sensitive type, I'd keep that in mind.","3.0","Good.","1358985600"
"Jennifer","B00ABKWSTA","My husband and I go through so much PB2 that it was a huge relief to find such big jars (btw, this comes in jars, not bags as pictured). This product is amazing because it has like 1/5 of the calories of regular peanut butter while still tasting great. I usually mix it with a little water or almond milk to use as a spread, but you can also put it into protein muffins, shakes, oatmeal or even on top of ice cream if you're weird like us. The jar even suggests using it in stir fry or Thai food, which I haven't tried yet but I think would be great.I personally prefer the regular flavor, but my husband loves the chocolate so the combo pack is great for us. My main complaint about the chocolate flavor is the lack of chocolatey-ness, so if I use it I tend to add a little extra cocoa powder and a sweetener. Obviously this is not going to be as rich as regular peanut butter, which is why I like to rehydrate it with almond or coconut milk.

"Chandler","B00AKPO042","Sargol saffron is known as the best, most precious, and one of the most expensive spices in the world.And this is pure sargol saffron.A wonderful gift for a foodie friend for Christmas, this is a spice one might not be likely to splurge on for themselves, but would love to have at home for the unique flavors it will impart to your dishes.  And it does have a wealth of rich flavor.Sargol saffron has this deep and rich color and even greater flavor than saffron threads you'd find in the store.  Better yet, you only need a few threads to enrichen an entire dish and impart its golden yellow color.  Commonly used for saffron rice, it will change the flavor immensely of many things in a wonderful and savory way.Sargol saffron means ""top grade"" as this is cultivated from the top of the flower.  Saffron is so expensive because each thread is taken from the stamen of a flower.  It provides higher color and greater flavor than other saffron.Saffron Chickpea Stew with Grilled Porcini Mushrooms and Black GarlicVegetarian, vegan, gluten free and kosherServes 4About 20 ounces fresh porcini mushrooms (sauteed morels would be great too, if less dramatic - don't grill `em)Extra-virgin olive oil (about 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons)Kosher salt1 large white onion, minced3 tablespoons double-concentrated tomato paste (or 6 tablespoons regular tomato paste)8 cloves minced garlicNice big pinch saffron threads1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika1 teaspoon sugar1 cup dry white wine5 cups cooked chickpeas (preferably home cooked; see above for more discussion)Freshly ground black pepperThinly sliced Pre-Peeled Black Garlic, chopped with kitchen shears (to taste; you can use black garlic very liberally as it is not bitter or pungent, but sweet)Preheat the oven to 450. Cut the porcinis in half, lengthwise. Place the porcinis on enough tin foil to wrap them. You may want to make two packets. Toss them with a little olive oil and a couple pinches of salt and seal them into packets. Roast until tender (see above). Time will really depend on the size of the mushrooms; mine took about 30 minutes. When tender, open,  then reserve.Meanwhile, put a generous 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, tomato paste, garlic, saffron, smoked paprika, sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onion and tomato have turned a nice rust color.Add the wine and scrape (deglaze) the bottom of the pan to incorporate all the  browned bits. Add the chickpeas, find a low simmer, and cook for about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to create a saucy consistency. It should definitely not be dry, but neither are we making soup. Taste and adjust seasoning. Besides salt, it might need more smoked paprika.Set your serving bowls or plates aside to warm up. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Brush the cut side of the porcinis with a bit of olive oil and grill until nice grill marks develop. Rotate 90 degrees and create a crosshatch pattern.When you are ready to serve, give the chickpea stew one last adjustment for taste and texture and divide among the serving bowls. Top with some freshly ground black pepper and a little drizzle of olive oil. Arrange the porcini on top of the chickpeas. Garnish with the black garlic and serve immediately.Saffron provided my Mehr, Review is my honest and unbiased opinion","5.0","The finest saffron, top","1385164800"

Actually, the taste is tolerable if it's very, very cold, or if you just toss it into the blender and add a banana and some berries of your own.  That helps a LOT!  Then, we just use those always cold cups you can get at Dick's sporting goods and take these with us as a pick-up.  They're great for when you're trying to lose weight and need extra protein.  Or, if you have giant teenage boys with bottomless stomachs and don't want them eating a bunch of junk all the time.  All that does is add senseless calories and cause them to eat more.  This has protein, which fills them up and gives them the energy they need.  Grab some celery and add either peanut butter or Nutella, and you have a filling snack.But do NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT drink these warm!  They are pretty gagging unless they're cold.  They have a bit of an aftertaste, like you're eating Sensa or one of those sugar free additives.

The flavored varieties were definitely softer and more pleasant to eat.I was really looking forward to the chocolate variety because I'm a huge chocolate fan.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when I tried it.

I had previously purchased another organic halvah here, made by Achva, but, although it was very nice, I found that it had been made with added palm oil, which is not very good for the health at all, or for the environment (and it also made for a very greasy halvah). Also, original halvah recipes have no need for added palm oil, or any other kind of added oil for that matter, as the oil that drains from the ground up sesame seeds themselves is more than sufficient, and gives halvah that perfect texture that halvah is known for. I was thrilled to find that, not only is this organic halvah healthier with its mere two ingredients, but it actually tastes far superior to all other halvah I have ever had. The texture is that miraculous combination of creamy and powdery that you dream of when you imagine biting into a really nice halvah. And I enjoyed it all the more imagining this might be similar to something that could have been enjoyed in ancient Greece, way before awful things like ""corn syrup"" and ""glucose syrup"" were ever invented.

"eyecore","B00BDFNTNQ","The flavor is OK.And now, on to the negative parts of this ""popcorn...""Well, the first 2 ingredients are sweeteners:  corn syrup, and sugar.  And you can be sure the corn syrup is from GMO/poison corn, in case that's a concern for you.  The third ingredient is...uhhh...  ""Whole Grain Popcorn.""  I think that's their attempt to make it sound like there's anything healthy about this by including ""whole grain.""  The seed is the grain - making popcorn without the entire grain...is that even possible?  Anyway, it's another strike from the ingredients list - and I'm not going to type out all the other chemical ingredients.Moving on to actually eating this stuff - I already mentioned the highlights of the product, but the texture is just plain weird.  It's like they coated the popcorn with batter (corn flour is ingredient #4...) to give it a weird coating that doesn't have texture anything like actual popcorn.  Quite frankly, it's not good either.  I can sometimes look past chemical ingredients if the product has a great flavor and texture - this has neither.  Basically, ConAgra dreamed up an entirely new food, couldn't figure out how to make it grow by itself via genetically modifying it, and instead combined a bunch of stuff that doesn't look, feel, or taste like popcorn.  Take the ""Brown Sugar Cinnamon,"" for example.  Brown sugar is there (ingredient #5, making sweeteners 3 of the top 5), but cinnamon isn't actually anywhere in this bad of Brown Sugar Cinnamon popcorn.Perhaps I'm not on the bandwagon of eating whatever a company decides I'll like, in favor of eating something wholesome AND delicious, but this product is basically garbage.  Want something that tastes better, with a better texture and less expensive?  Go buy some plain popcorn (pop it yourself if you'd like), butter, corn syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking soda and vanilla.  Then head over to Bing and do a quick search.  In a little while, you'll be having some delicious brown sugar cinnamon popcorn.  Depending on how you want the texture, you may not even need a couple ingredients, including the corn syrup.As with many things in life, food can be Quality, Fast, or Cheap.

This was too mellow for me, I like my dark roast to have a bit of a bite and have that dark, almost-burnt aroma. That was missing in this coffee.In fact, my husband made it for me and I didn't even notice it was this coffee until he told me. You might as well just buy coffee in a can from the supermarket.

"csm","B00BIEU5QQ","I think it's a bit hard to describe this coffee.  It is weak and strong at the same time, if that makes any sense.  It reminds me of Starbuck's - just quite bitter at the end, in particular, and with little actual coffee flavor.  Starbuck's has more flavor, however, and this one reminds me of Starbuck's Blonde series, but with less flavor.I cleaned the pot before trying this - ground the beans, which were very light, I might add, and then brewed it in my percolator.  I used one scoop per cup too, which is more than what I regularly use with Caribou, but since the beans were so very light, particularly for a medium roast coffee, I thought I'd better be cautious and use more just in case.  That was a good decision.  This Community Coffee has a very thin, weak flavor, which is followed by a bitterness.  It cannot compare to 8 O'clock coffee or Caribou.  Heavens, Folger's gourmet versions far outweigh this coffee.  The name is appropriate - it reminds you of something you would get at a car dealership, served in a Styrofoam cup, while you're waiting to have your oil changed.In addition, I think the best use for this brand would be to use it with flavorings, then pour it over ice.  But just for breakfast, it's too weak for cream, but too bitter at the end to not make you want to wash your throat out with mouthwash.  Try Caribou's Daybreak coffee instead - it's absolutely amazing!  I do have to say, however, that this brand certainly does NOT stand up to all the southern brand of coffees I have consumed in the past.

When brewed identically with the 3 cups side-by-side, I felt that the Breakfast Blend had a slightly more bitter and acidic aftertaste. So, of Community Coffee's offerings I've tried: for a darker, stronger tone, the Sumatran Reserve remains my favorite, and for a milder flavor, the Columbian.","3.0","Fairly Mild-flavored, but...","1373068800"

"nonpareil","B00BIEU71E","First impressions: None of the three bags received were vacuum-packed in the manner that withdraws air from bag and leaves the bag material tightly air-free and clinging to the bean bodies. However the expiration date of the packages is 12/22/13, giving plenty of time for consumption. Upon opening, I found the beans to have a fresh aroma and the consistent dark oily appearance expected of a dark roast.Prep: I carefully cleaned my Mr. Coffee burr grinder whose grind adjustment is 1/3 of the way into the fine grind setting. I shook out as many of the old beans as possible, then ran fresh beans from this bag through and dumped the results, brushing out all visible debris, hoping for no contamination. Then and only then I ground for this pot.Brew: Made a full 12-cup pot in a long-used, familiar Gevalia automatic drip machine. Carafe cleaned regularly with baking soda and well rinsed. Water allowed to run prior to filling machine in order to clear stale water from pipes.Cuppa Joe style: Used my preferred method of 1/2 cup skim milk heated in microwave, topped off with 1/3 cup freshly brewed coffee. No sweetener.Analysis: Right off I was hit with floral, winey notes. I felt smoothness with strength. Then the intensity of traditional dark roast broke in a very pleasant way. The smoky intensity lingered as an aftertaste, also pleasant and satisfying. Suddenly the fog left and I was delightfully wide awake so there is plenty of caffeine which is, for me, a requirement.Recommendation: Outstanding price/value.

"jt","B00BIEU9M6","Much better than I thought. When ordering this coffee I expected a form of fairly inexpensive ""office"" coffee which in my experience falls between not so good and quite bland.  You drink it to help stay awake during those afternoon meetings.  When the coffee arrived and I opened a bag I thought there was a bit of an off smell.  The smell was quite strong when I grounded the beans.  It was sort of a sour odor.  I thought for sure the coffee was bad.  I brewed a pot and I have to say that it was not bad.  It was actually pretty decent.  I have no idea why the sour smell but, it didn't seem to translate in the brewed coffee.  I drink Sumatra from either Starbucks or Peet's basically everyday.  This coffee doesn't seem to have the depth of flavor of those but it isn't bad.  It has a much smoother less acidic taste and seems a bit thicker on the palate.  The acidity thing is definitely a taste preference thing.  I like a little more bite to my brew.  I don't think I would switch to this coffee but, if one likes Sumatra with a bit more of a milder flavor and this stuff were well priced, I think it a good buy.","4.0","Good Sumatra on the Milder Side","1374105600"

Whether you have to be on a gluten-free diet or not, these pretzels are good and I would recommend them.","5.0","good pretzels","1381881600"

He doesn't like it as much as the Edensoy Carob but still drinks it. My only problem is that this product contains CARRAGEENAN. Overall, t's still better then Pediasure, which contains also carrageenan and has 23g of sugar, 10g more then Orgain shake!

"csm","B00BLMFL9Q","In general, I've always liked Ghiardelli's products, with the exception of the dark chocolate. So, I ordered this item in great anticipation of their delectable delights. However, it contains a great deal of the dark chocolate items. The top box is filled only with their intense Cocao chocolate which, to me, is quite strong and something I've NEVER been able to stomach. You might be able to handle it but me, well, it makes me quite ill. Just too strong and rich for my blood.The middle box is milk chocolate caramel, which is my favorite. But unfortunately, they were melted and SMASHED!  How on earth that happened is beyond me. The candy is disgusting once it has melted since the cream separates from the chocolate. You have the proteins from the cream escaping and well, it's just nasty. Rats on that box!The third and largest box is filled only with dark chocolate again, but this one contains fillings such as mint, caramel, and raspberry. They're good, but again, if you don't care for dark chocolate, then you're hosed. And this was the worst box of all for melting an being smashed - so bad that it came through the wrapper.I'll use these for coffee flavorings since that's always amazing. I can't think of any other use for melted chocolate like this. If you have an idea, please let me know. This would be a great gift if you have someone on your list who loves dark chocolate. But for the price, well, I'm not so sure that it would be good for a summer party, unless you're having a coffee bar then they would be great for that. Melt one of these in a cup of espresso, pour it over ice and you'll have an awesome treat! Recommend for the candy because it's just awesome, but amazon gets a thumbs down on the shipping of this item. They double-boxed it but hey, after spending an afternoon riding around in a truck in 90-degree heat, two boxes won't make much difference.Recommend, but with the above caution.","3.0","Melted upon arrival!","1372118400"

The screw top lid is a nice touch, kids can eat part and throw the rest in their lunch box without fear that it will spill.I think kids will like the idea of squeezing it out like toothpaste.A tip for parents: The first pack opened very easily for me, but the second one didn't.

Not normally a problem for most, but I happen to be allergic to NutraSweet so it is quite the deal for me. Even if you aren't, NutraSweet is stored in the brain - not eliminated from your body.  Not safe to use, hands down.Anyway, if none of these things worry you, then be sure to try this.  It really tastes amazing!

I've made multiple cups. I love iced tea, and I drink both sweet tea and un all summer. I figured these would be nice if I'm between pitchers. But the flavor is off in some subtle way. There's maybe a slightly chemical aftertaste? Our coffeemaker can make three sizes of coffee with the k-cups in place. I've tried all three sizes. The big cup is too weak, the medium size is bland, and the small cup is okay, but not nearly as good as homemade tea. Don't know why, but the result has been consistent.

I like to add that more ice will likely be needed to get a true ice cold tea but the strength is still quite good.In relation to the price of these K cups versus just buying a box of like a 100 tea bags and making it the original way the latter is quite cheaper.

And there are a lot of them.The salsa has a superb smoky flavor, almost like a liqueur, with just the right bite - I like &#34;spicy&#34; - and is a runny consistency so best eaten with a spoon as it would drip off a chip. It says it is filled with the healthy vegetables that I like to include in my diet. But I don't feel comfortable eating prepared food that has an unknown ingredient like this black stuff.

This is my go-to super easy appetizer.  Just pour over a block of cream cheese and serve with crackers.  Another great way to try it is to mix with the cream cheese and use as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken.  Sweet salsas can be a bit much all on their own but with cream cheese are amazing!These Arriba! brand salsas are equivalent to the ones I usually buy from Harry & David, but are cheaper.  The subscribe & save discount makes them an even better deal.  Since they are good for a long time if unopened, I plan to keep an extra set on hand as needed for last minute hostess gifts.

But when I opened that crockpot seven hours later, it smelled sooo good. This made the kind of chicken that will have you relishing your burps later in the evening. The instructions on the back recommend skinless boneless chicken, but I used skin on and bone in because it makes a more flavorful stew. Plus half the appeal of Moroccan chicken is in what that spice blend does to the skin, and such was the case here. Taking the bones out is a minor aggravation. Someone accidentally picked up Quinoa instead of cous cous to go with this, but it turned out to be a good pairing because the chewiness of the Quinoa against the tenderness of the stew worked out very well.","4.0","Morrocan Spiced Stew with Green Olives and Lemon","1390262400"

The K-cup comes is inside of a plastic container. The container and the K-cup are recyclable, but unless you remove the K-cup from the container, it won't fit into the K-cup carousel.

I'm a Caribou coffee drinker and although theirs is MUCH smoother and better tasting, I think Melitta will get better in time.The best part, however, is when you take the pod out of the container - just like opening a fresh pack of coffee!  SO love that part!  I miss smelling that fresh coffee aroma with these k-cups and Melitta has found a way to capture that experience.Don't pass this one by - it's a good, overall blend, somewhere between Folger's and Maxwell House with Maxwell being on the bottom end of the spectrum in my book.

The entire cup is a filter so it not only yields more coffee but you can reuse the cups without compromising taste.  We actually can use these camping (cowboy coffee style) even without a K-cup brewer.  Love that.This particular roast (a mix of light and dark--not 6 dark cups and 6 light like I was expecting but a mix of light and dark roast in each cup) was a bit too strong for me and not very smooth with a bit of a harsh taste.

He drinks it black and used the extra bold setting (the largest cup of the 3 sizes) and I drink it with milk on the medium size setting.  The taste was smooth with a little bitter bite which we like.  The different design of the K-cup worked fine but unlike the advertising which says you can smell it brewing, we didn't smell anything.  One of the reasons we tried these was because of the recyclable cup.  But it's wrapped in non-recyclable plastic and you have to remove the coffee from the cup - so not much of a ""green"" savings and a bit of a pain to boot.  Between that and the higher cost of these compared to other K-cups we like (Starbucks Dark Roast and Sumatran Reserve), would probably not buy again.","3.0","Decent K Cup/Expensive","1383523200"

Heavens, I fell in love with this so fast that I even took two of these and used it in my percolator!  Oh, I can't tell you how amazing that pot of coffee was that day.  If you like a richer brew, one more flavorful, then be SURE to give this a spin.  If you're more of the lighter roast preferences, then you probably will find this to be a bit strong.Here's an added plus: If you're like me and like to take your k-cups out of their original boxes and put them in one of those stands, then THESE HAVE THE EXPIRATION DATE PRINTED ON THE K-CUP!  None of the other brands that I've used so far have ever done that.  NO more stale coffee!  SO glad the folks at Melitta are dedicated to coffee!The coffee was black when I poured it from my percolator, not light brown, and it was steaming hot.  Have I made you get up and make a pot yet?!!! So awesome, SO glad I found this, SO will be ordering it forever!  Plus, Melitta has developed a new k-cup so that when you open it, you have that fresh coffee aroma instead of just a piece of foil like the others have.That said, they do make you prime your Keurig a bit more often because I think there's more contact with the actual coffee in these pods.  No worries, however.  If that's what it takes to get a great cup of coffee from my Keurig, then, Oh well!

I've found that Nutella's can be a bit oily at times, gunks up and gets thick in the jar. Not so with this Hershey's variety. It's very smooth - think of peanut butter without oil, or even icing, and the flavor is amazing. Gotta LOVE Hershey's!

We sorta started a trend here with this - it's just an amazing sandwich with protein and fruit, but one that tastes WAY better than Pb&J;!

There is still quite a bit of sugar and fat.  They seem to be trying to pull buyers in by following the new trend of eating healthier and making wiser choices with food.  The packaging with its listing of ingredients like eggs, butter bold and bright seems to be making the buyer believe these cookies are better for you and healthier.  Bottom line, these still carry the same level of fat and sugar Keebler cookies always have.  No matter how cookies are made they will always be a guilty pleasure in regards to healthy eating. And the most important thing is the portion size.  So when it comes to treats you should eat what you enjoy and just be realistic about portion.

This is in contrast to many factory-made cookies that contain a lot of things you would never cook with at home.In terms of taste and texture, these were great.  There were enough chocolate chips to be able to taste them in every bite, but not so many that I couldn't taste the cookie as well.  Also, I could definitely tell they were made with real butter, which is something I love in a cookie.The packaging wasn't ideal.

They are starting to target the Spanish community and this lemon sandwich cookie is one of the first to have Spanish writing on the package.  Just mentioned this for some thought it didn't look like a regular Keebler product.  Now to the cookie.  I think people will either really like or dislike this product.  I am a citrus lover, lemon in particular but I hate it when things are overly sweet.  The lemon flavor is in both the cookie and the filling and for me the flavoring was perfect.  The lemon taste was refreshing and ever so lightly tart without giving me a sugar rush.  It is true that the cookies are thinner than some other sandwich cookies and some who like a lot of filling may not find these cookies to their liking.  For me the cookies that are overstuffed are again often too sweet.  So if you prefer your cookies thick and flowing with filling these may not be for you.  But if you are trying to find a cookie where you can enjoy the cookie itself as well as the filling without it being cloying in taste I recommend these cookies.

They are bite-sized, but the chocolate tends to stick to itself, so you either have to pry the pieces apart or bite the stuck-together clusters in half. A minor complaint.They come in a plastic snack-size container that has a lid, so you don't have to eat all of them, if you don't want to. I thought this was a great idea, because too often, I feel obliged to eat more than I want, or risk the food going stale.Five stars!

It seems like a waste of packaging to make little containers that are too big to act as a single serving but not big enough to last very long.

They're very bland.I know I've got a serious sweet tooth so maybe that's the problem, and I'm sure these would be a better choice for a parent concerned about sugar content, but I really like my gummies to pack a serious sweet flavor punch, and these simply don't live up to that. I know one of the flavors was some sort of citrus (orange?) because it looked like a little orange slice, but I really couldn't tell. The same with something that I think was strawberry. It's the kind of candy that, when I start eating it, I think to myself: ""Do I really want to waste calories on this?"" and then put them down and never think of them again. Zero craving for them.

There is less than 2% (probably closer to 0%) strawberry ingredients in these, and quite frankly, they taste nothing like a strawberry.  Go ahead, try it:  have somebody eat one of these without knowing the flavor (or looking at it), and ask them the flavor.

So for the price and quantity this seemed like the perfect choice....and it was! The product came the next day with no added charge. Then when I tasted it I was blown away with how much I loved the flavor because I usually do not care for the flavor (reminds me of wheatgrass) and just drink it for the health benefits and use it in skin care.  Instead of using this only once and a while like before, I look forward to drinking this daily! I know it is culinary grade instead of ceremonial but I guess I like the 'lower' grade better. Although I don't really believe it is any less of a 'grade' because it makes me feel great, as in...energy all day and a clear head! I've already used it in some deserts and loved it.

I really didn't expect it to be great or anything, after all I've been spoiled by the warm goodness of the popcorn shops in Chicago, but this bagged popcorn exceeded my expectations.The bag is a decent size and has a re-sealable top, which is great if needed (not! two people scarfed down the whole thing in one sitting). The popcorn kernels were fairly large, and the flavor of the cheddar and caramel corn was just right. No single flavor overpowered the other, it was a perfect blend. The cheese wasn't too harsh or gooey, and the caramel wasn't overly sweet. I didn't really notice the kettle corn flavor, but no matter: eating it all intermingled is the best way to experience this popcorn. I was also impressed by how fresh it tasted, maybe thanks to the sturdy bag it comes in.The only reason I took a star off is that I think it's a little overpriced. I personally wouldn't want to pay more than $4 for a bag if I were to eat this stuff on a regular basis, but for special occasions I would splurge and buy it.

"Butterworth","B00EDHW7F2","I noticed something recently that's a quick way of sorting out high-quality coffee from the so-so kind: Note the amount of cream it takes to lighten it.  The cheap stuff takes practically no cream to turn a pale, beige color.  The good stuff will take a good deal more cream to lighten it, and it will NEVER turn a pale, beige color.  It will always be a rich, full-bodied shade of brown. (Body-wise, it's like the difference between skim milk and half-and-half.)  Unfortunately, the cheap coffee TASTES like skim milk compared to half-and-half.  You know something essential is missing.  That's the case with Caza Trail Donut Shop Coffee ... it's just not good coffee.  In case I sound like a &#34;coffee snob,&#34; too good to drink donut shop coffee, I find the coffee in the two most popular national donut chains delicious.  Those enterprises understand that people want a good cup of coffee with their donuts ... and in order to get that, the company has to shell out the money for it.  Cheap coffee is lousy coffee.

This is convenient if you're at work and don't happen to have a bowl handy.  The glass jar also makes it easy to freeze leftover soup.

The bad: they're really expensive, and half of the bag was crushed upon arrival.  I don't know if this is normal, as I've only ordered once, but it was pretty annoying.  They ship in their own box, which was further within an undamaged Amazon shipping box, so I'm not sure at what point they got crushed.  I still &#34;drank&#34; the crushed dust from the bag (a trick I learned back in my Dorito days), but it definitely felt less than ideal-- especially at this price point.  Overall a good effort, but hard to see them as a snacking staple.","3.0","Good taste but half the bag was crushed...","1391040000"

You have to practically empty the container if you're making a large bowl of popcorn to get the flavor distributed throughout the whole batch.

"barry","B00H727WVY","These Kernel Seasonings are a great idea and this sweet variety pack is the first I've tried.  They are marketed first for popcorn which I found didn't work for me.  I air pop my popcorn and don't use any oil at all.  I tried to shake some in with the popcorn but without anything to make it adhere it wouldn't stay on.  I tried sprinkling it on like salt and it also didn't work.  But I did try the seasonings in a bunch of other creative ways.  All three worked great with oatmeal, ice cream and the caramel and milk chocolate caramel both worked great with coffee.  I didn't find these too sweet and you can also use as much or as little as you need.  I did find these flavors in particular to not be suitable with pasta, veggies or other healthy foods but am sure other flavors available would.  These seasonings are very creative, not expensive and do add flavor.  I definitely recommend them and will be trying other flavors.","4.0","Great idea","1401062400"

In my search for the perfect K-cup of coffee, I bought this hoping for rich, smooth flavor without being too strong or bitter (also because the box is cute, although I hate the name - &#34;sleazy&#34; is not the right word here). I'm trying to achieve at home what I get when I order half coffee/half water at Starbucks.  Right now, I buy a strong-flavored k-cup and double brew it using the same one twice - don't judge - I shouldn't have to sacrifice deliciousness because I don't like strong coffee.  Unfortunately, this one ended up just weak instead of the promised 'light roast.'If you like weak, watered-down-tasting coffee without having to water it down for yourself, this one is for you.

"Kiwi","B00HES9CMS","I am pleasantly thrilled with the quality and texture of this organic cacao powder. IT IS DELICIOUS! It is better than any cacao powder I have used recently or bought at my local, village store. It is silky smoothe and melts effortlessly into coconut oil... I add a little honey and walnuts to this mixture to make mouthwatering chocolate candy. When the mood hits and you need something sweet in a hurry, this is the way I go.Cacao is very high in magnesium which is a good thing as 99% of the population has a magnesium deficiency. It's also a good source of potassium and will add a bit of iron to the system. If you're eating lots of chocolate, (and hey, I'm not judging), make sure you're getting enough zinc in your diet as chocolate is high in copper and can offset the necessary copper/zinc balance. Otherwise indulging in a super healthy food to keep your body in tip top shape, is a happy thing.The price is right on this product and I like that it comes in a bag rather than a tub. It's non-GMO, Organic, Vegan and Gluten free, a *Product of Peru.*  The expiration date is 02 June 2016 so I know this product is delivered fresh and it certainly tastes it. I will recommend this product to many and keep my cupboards stocked in the meantime.Once opened, I always keep my cacao powder in the freezer with my protein powders, chia seeds, maca powder, hemp powder and ground flax seeds.","5.0","It's *LICK THE SPOON* good.....","1405555200"
"ChrisNY","B00HHFWJS2","These are convenient alternatives to pureeing and freezing your own veggies and they tasted fairly &#34;fresh.&#34;  They worked well in smoothies and juice drinks and the squash puree tasted fine in place of some of the oil in a batch of brownies I made. (You use about half the amount of puree instead of the oil, e.g., +/- 1/2 cup puree if you need 1 cup oil - so I use about half a cup of oil and 1/4 cup puree).That said, I found the portion size annoying.  There are 9 pouches but the nutrition info says 15 servings.  And each serving contains mostly vitamin A and not so much fiber so you're not getting all the &#34;additional&#34; nutrition you might think.  But sneaking in a little is better than nothing though at this price, I will continue to make my own.","3.0","Convenient But Expensive","1395014400"
"Cordelia","B00HHFWJS2","I agree with the reviewers who commented that these pouches amount to a very small portion of vegetables per serving, at least in the recipes given. A simple solution would be to make the pouches larger. The product is targeting parents of picky eaters, but it could have a wider audience. For example, I have a butternut squash lasagna recipe that works great with the squash puree, but I need lots of it. I could easily add a bunch of pouches of spinach to one pot of pasta sauce. The carrot puree was great in a chicken curry I made. They added color, taste, and richness.However, the pouches themselves pose problems. They are not resealable, and so you either need to use the whole pouch or find an awkward way to store what's left. A different form of packaging, such as re-usable and recyclable squirt bottles for easy measuring, would be more convenient. Between the carton and the plastic pouches, this is an awful lot of packaging for a small amount of vegetables. And, the cost is much more than making your own. I would like to see individual flavors offered in addition to the combo pack, so that you can simply purchase the ones that work for you.Along with some other reviewers, I dislike the concept of hiding the vegetables to get kids to eat them. It does nothing to educate the children in good nutrition habits, not to mention the simple enjoyment of healthy food, which will be harder to learn later. Instead, involve the kids in cooking, learn to cook fresh, colorful vegetables properly and in interesting and tasty ways so that children can learn the real, delightful taste of vegetables. The puree is like, well, baby food.","3.0","A lot of packaging and hefty price for a little bit of vegetables","1398988800"

"nonpareil","B00HKGB9ZW","This instant coffee has a lot of the attributes people are looking for: non-GMO, organic, &#34;fair trade&#34;, freeze-dried. It comes in a square glass bottle with an odd snap-on top and has a foil seal. The two bottles were packed exceptionally well, in a recyclable heavy, custom-fit cardboard within cardboard container. Classy.So how does it taste? Well - really good. I mean I usually brew coffee from grounds, often even freshly ground beans but sometimes the situation calls for a cuppa instant so I keep some in the fridge. Think &#34;gotta have that first cup while the pot is still brewing&#34; or &#34;ran the carafe dry but still need caffeine&#34; or &#34;for some reason I'm off the grid like backpacking or on a kayak or even vehicle road trip and am reduced to my trusty little travelling stove&#34;.So in this case I microwave a cup of 1% milk and stir in a generous teaspoon of these Cafe Altura granules. Foam results. It isn't too difficult to get the granules to dissolve in the hot milk. Pretty darn good.

"ringo","B00HKGB9ZW","I've been drinkingMount Hagen Instant Coffeefor years, and I've lately started buying it via Amazon Prime in the six-pack, so I was happy to get this brand to compare. I found the taste of the Cafe Altura to be notably different.The directions for the Cafe Altura say ""1-2 tsp in a cup of hot water,"" and the directions for the Mt. Hagen say ""1 level tsp in a cup of boiling water"". Since both claim to make 60 cups per 100 gram jar, however, in the interests fairness I prepared both using 1 level teaspoon, in a measured cup of water fresh off boil.- In appearance both brands are identical, both in the jar and after preparation.- In a freshly opened jar, the scent of the Mt. Hagen is notably more buttery. The Cafe Altura, in contrast, has a sharp, almost oily overtone.- When prepared black, I vastly prefer the Mt. Hagen. The buttery scent translates to a buttery finish, though it does have a slightly more acid overtone. The Cafe Altura, on the other hand, retains the oily overtone, and tastes sharp by comparison.- When mixed with milk (Jersey, full-fat), the Cafe Altura makes a comeback. The flavor of the Mt. Hagen washes out, while the oiliness of the Cafe Altura is mitigated.- When sugar is added to the milk (organic, muscovado), the Cafe Altura falls back again. Sugar enhances the natural coffee flavor of both, which lets the Mt. Hagen pull ahead.Overall, I will continue to buy the Mt. Hagen.  As a dissenting opinion, however, I should note that my partner now prefers the Cafe Altura. He actually puts *butter* in his coffee, and apparently this works well.(I typed this review very quickly).","3.0","Comparison with Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee","1398470400"

I am just an average baker so I will need some practice changing around the ratio of dry ingredients to get the consistency right.  My first attempt was a chocolate sheet cake, which the batter normally has a very runny consistency, but this time was so thick it was almost like dough.  That may well be due to the gluten-free flour I used.  I intentionally overbaked it, going for a more brownie texture, but it would have been better and probably pretty close to normal if I hadn't done that.  The kids and I liked it fine at any rate, and they didn't mention any aftertaste, though I noticed it.  I will update when I make the cake again with regular flour. I will also try some of the 25 recipes on the company's website specifically formulated for this product.

"ephemeral","B00JL6LTMW","I love granola, so I thought it would be interesting to try this oat-free granola.  Without the oats, it amounts to sweetened mixed nuts.  I found it to be overly sweet, and the nuts and seeds seemed a little soft or maybe stale.  They definitely didn't have the crunch that I normally associate with them.It's not clear to me why someone would want to eat granola without oats.  The package is marked as gluten free, but oats don't have any gluten in them either.  I suppose if you just don't like oats you might be interested in this, but frankly I think there are better and cheaper alternatives if you want a seed and nut mix.  Don't get me wrong- the mix isn't bad; I ended up stirring it into cereal and it mellowed the flavor quite nicely.

The pouches of oatmeal in this multi-pack are no where near big enough for a full meal, but they certainly can serve as a nice snack.I loved the apple cinnamon oatmeal, which had real chunks of dehydrated apples.  It was tasty and not too sweet.  The maple syrup oatmeal, on the other hand, was sickly sweet, and I had a hard time getting it down.  The plain oatmeal is just that- plain; it's pretty hard to mess up plain oatmeal.  I love how few ingredients are used to make all three flavors.  Oatmeal is a classic food that really doesn't need need a lot of added flavors or preservatives.This oatmeal is easy enough to cook in the microwave, and it turned out good for me, but I did need to cook it for slightly more than the 2 minutes suggested on the box.  The instructions say you can add 2/3 cup of water or fill up the oatmeal pouch to a certain line.  Well, you should definitely measure the water because depending on how tightly you are holding the pouch open or closed, there is a huge amount of variation in how much water it will take to reach the line.","4.0","maple syrup flavor too sweet, others great","1405382400"
